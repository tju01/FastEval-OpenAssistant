We know that she ran out of eggs today, so we can call today \"Day 0\". Therefore, the number of days that have passed is:\n\n0 days + 40 days = 40 days\n\nNow that we know the number of days that have passed, we can calculate the number of days til the next time Jane eats eggs. To do this, we can subtract the number of days worth of eggs from the number of days that have passed:\n\n40 days - 40 days worth of eggs = -40 days (negative days means days til the next time Jane eats eggs)\n\nSince Jane ate one egg per day, we can also convert the negative days to multiples of the number of eggs eaten per day:\n\n-40 days \u00f7 1 egg/day = -40 days\n\nNow that we know the number of days til the next time Jane eats eggs, we can calculate the date by adding the number of days til the next time she eats eggs to Day 0:\n\nDay 0 + -40 days = -40 days (today)\n\nTherefore, the answer is -40 days (the date 24 hours later is -40 days before May 9th, 2017, which is December 9th, 2016).

This date matches with the format MM/DD/YYYY, where MM represents the month and DD represents the day. Since 07 represents July, 09 represents the 9th day of July, and 1972 represents the year.
