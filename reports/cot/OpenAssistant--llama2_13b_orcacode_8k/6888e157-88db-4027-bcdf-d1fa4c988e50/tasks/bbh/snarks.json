            "model_answer": "The statement that is sarcastic is option (A) \"You're welcome my dear friend. Always glad to feed the elephants, that woefully endangered species.\" \n\nThe sarcasm in this statement is evident from the use of the phrase \"always glad to feed\" which implies that the speaker is not actually glad to feed the elephants, but rather mocking the idea of feeding them. Additionally, the use of the word \"endangered\" (referring to the elephants) suggests that the speaker is criticizing those who feed the elephants, implying that it is a waste of time and resources to do so. \n\nTherefore, option (A) is sarcastic and implies that the speaker is mocking the idea of feeding elephants. \n\nThe correct answer to this question is (A).",

Blocking it is such a smart move!\nThis statement seems to express agreement with the idea of blocking the river, suggesting that it is a good idea. This tone is inconsistent with the fact that blocking the river would actually cause a lack of water and electricity, which would be a negative consequence. Therefore, this statement is sarcastic.\n\n(B) Without the river there's no water and no electricity. Blocking it is such a terrible move!\nThis statement expresses disagreement with the idea of blocking the river, suggesting that it would be a bad idea. This tone is consistent with the fact that blocking the river would actually cause a lack of water and electricity, which would be a negative consequence.

            "model_answer": "The statement that is sarcastic is (A) \"What a poor guy, years of work and he only got a $50,000 scholarship\". \n\nThe reason for this is that the word \"poor\" is used ironically, as getting a $50,000 scholarship is not considered poor by most people. The speaker is actually being sarcastic and suggesting that the $50,000 is not enough. \n\nIn contrast, statement (B) \"What a poor guy, years of work and he only got a $50 scholarship\" is not sarcastic, as the word \"poor\" is used to express genuine sympathy for the person who only received a small scholarship.",

Sarcasm is a form of irony that uses words to say the opposite of what you really mean. It is often used to express contempt, ridicule, or mockery.\n\nStep 2: Next, we need to look at the two options given in the question.\n\nStep 3: Option (A) states \"That's only about $0.15 per mile for a van, perfectly reasonable fuel costs.\" This statement seems to be making a sarcastic remark. \n\nStep 4: Option (B) states \"That's only about $10 per mile for a van, perfectly reasonable fuel costs.\" This statement is a factual statement and does not contain any sarcasm.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we can conclude that option (A) is the sarcastic statement.",
