If the degree of z(x) is m and the degree of f(x) is n, then z(x) will divide f(x) with the degree of m. \n\nNow, let's apply this to find all zeros of the polynomial f(x) = x^3 + 2x + 2 in the finite field F = Z_7. \n\nFirst, we factor out x from f(x) to get f(x) = x(x^2 + 2 + 2) = x(x^2 + 2 + 0). \n\nNext, we apply Rational Root Theorem to this factored form of the polynomial. \n\nIf z(x) is a rational root of f(x), then the degree of z(x) must divide the degree of f(x) = 2. So, if z(x) is a rational root of the polynomial, it must be satisfying z(x) = 0, x, 1, 2, or 3. \n\nNow, we test each z(x) to see which ones divide f(x) with degree 1 or 2. \n\nz(x) = 0: \nWhen z(x) = 0, the polynomial becomes x^3 + 2x + 2 = x(1+3).
