            "question": "The weight of an aspirin tablet is 300 milligrams according to the bottle label. An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim. Which of the following gives the P-value of this test?\n\n(A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(B) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(C) P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n(D) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what the P-value represents and how it is calculated in a hypothesis test.\n\nIn a hypothesis test, we are given a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (H1). We assume H0 is true and test whether there is enough evidence to reject H0 in favor of H1. In this case, H0 is that the manufacturer's claim that the aspirin tablet weight is 300 milligrams is true, and H1 is that the weight is not exactly 300 milligrams.\n\nThe P-value is the probability of observing the sample statistic (t-value) as extreme or more extreme given H0 is true. In other words, it's the probability of observing t-values as extreme as the one we obtained if the null hypothesis is true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question step by step:\n\n1. We have a sample of seven tablets, and each tablet has a weight measured as 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303.\n\n2. The FDA investigator assumes H0 is true and tests whether there is enough evidence to reject H0 in favor of H1. In other words, the investigator wants to know if there is enough evidence to conclude that the manufacturer's claim that the aspirin tablet weight is not exactly 300 milligrams is true.\n\n3. To calculate the P-value, we need to find the probability of obtaining a sample mean as extreme as the one we obtained if the null hypothesis is true. We use the formula:\n\n   P-value = P(t > t-statistic) = P(X > t) = F(t, df)\n\n   where t is the sample mean, X is the population mean, df is the degrees of freedom, and F(t, df) is the cumulative distribution function of the F-distribution with df degrees of freedom.\n\n4. In this case, the t-sketch of the student's t distribution has a t value of 2.75 with df = 6, which means that for a sample of seven tablets, we have df = 6. Therefore, we need to calculate the P-value for a sample mean at least 2.75 standard error units greater than the population mean.\n\n5. Using the t-distribution tables, we find that F(2.75, 6) = 0.0087. It means the probability of obtaining a sample mean at least 2.75 standard error units greater than the population mean if the null hypothesis is true is 0.0087.\n\n6. To convert the P-value into its symbolic form, we use the following data format: P(t > t-statistic) = P(X > t) = F(t, df). In this case, the P-value is 0.0087, and the t-statistic is t = 7 (because the sample mean is t = 7). Therefore, the answer is:\n\n   (C) P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n\n   (Note that 1.54 is the P-value calculated using the formula with the t-value of 1.54 instead of 2.75, which we used to estimate the P-value. The final answer is correct regardless of the value used in the P-value estimate.)",

If there are 150,000 riders the first summer, which of the following is the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders?\n\n(A) 0 to 31.7 minutes\n(B) 31.7 to 39.3 minutes\n(C) 25.3 to 44.7 minutes\n(D) 25.3 to 35 minutes",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The problem states that the waiting times for the roller coaster ride are normally distributed with a mean of 35 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes. This means that the distribution of waiting times will have a bell-shaped curve with the mean as the center of the distribution. The standard deviation of 10 minutes means that 68% of the waiting times will fall within 6.8 standard deviations of the mean (2 [standard error] * 6.8 = 13.6 minutes). This means that for 100,000 riders, we would expect 90,600 riders to have waiting times within [35-13.6, 35+13.6] = [21.4, 47.6] minutes. \n\nTo find the shortest time interval, we need to find the range that includes the shortest time interval and that contains 100,000 riders. We can do this by finding the range of 68% of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution. \n\nLet x be the standardized variable such that F(x) is the CDF of the normal distribution with a mean of 35 and a standard deviation of 10. Then F(x) = 1 - (1/2)(1+erf(x/sqrt(12.53))). \n\nFor 68% of the distribution, x = 35, which means x = 2.0 + 3 F(2.0) = 0.236. \n\nThe CDF function is given by F(x) = P(X < x), where P(X < x) is the probability of getting a value less than x. Therefore, we can find the shortest time interval by finding F(0.236). \n\nF(0.236) = 0.3136, which means that x = F(0.236) - 2.0 = -0.1136. This means that x has no solution in terms of integers or simple decimal numbers, so we cannot determine the shortest time interval directly. \n\nHowever, we can convert x to a fraction using the approximate fraction 1/sqrt(2.5) which is close to the value of 1/sqrt(12.53). \n\nx = (F(0.236) - 2.0) * 1/sqrt(12.53) \u2248 0.0075*1/sqrt(12.53) \u2248 1.86*10^-7 \u2248 0.186*1/1000\n\nThis means that the shortest time interval is (0, 0.1 minute). \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 0 to 0.1 minutes.",

The mean height of adult men is 70 inches and the mean height of adult women is 66 inches. This means that the mean height of men is greater than the mean height of women. \n\nNext, we need to compare the standard deviations of the heights for the two groups. The standard deviation of the heights for men is four inches and the standard deviation of the heights for women is three inches. This means that the standard deviation of the heights for men is greater than the standard deviation of the heights for women. \n\nGiven that the mean heights of the two groups are different, and the standard deviations of the heights for the two groups are different, we can use the z-score method to determine which person is more unusually tall within their respective sex. \n\nThe z-score method involves determining how many standard deviations above or below the mean height a person is. To do this, we subtract the mean height from the person's height and then divide by the standard deviation of the heights for their group. \n\nFor the man, his height of 74 inches is 74 - 70 = 4 standard deviations above the mean height of 70 inches. \n\nFor the woman, her height of 70 inches is 70 - 66 = 4 standard deviations above the mean height of 66 inches. \n\nSince the man's height is 4 standard deviations above the mean height of men and the woman's height is 4 standard deviations above the mean height of women, we cannot determine which person is more unusually tall within their respective sex based solely on this information. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) It cannot be determined, because the mean heights for the two groups are different.",
