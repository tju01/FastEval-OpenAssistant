The idea is that a matrix is used to map between subjects and access permissions. However, a problem with this approach is that it is not possible to express who has the rights to change the access matrix itself. In other words, there is no way to specify which users or groups have the authority to modify the permissions given to others. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities and can be a difficulty in implementation.",

However, to determine which option is correct, we need to test each option.\n\nOption A: {-6,-2,-1,1,2,6} - This option contains both positive and negative integers. To test this option, we can take two integers, say x=6 and y=8. Both 2 and -6 are common divisors of 6 and 8, so this option is not correct.\n\nOption B: {-6,-2,-1,0,1,2,6} - This option contains both positive and negative integers, and a 0.

To test this option, we can take x=6 and y=12.

We know that version 1 retrieves blocks of 1,000 bytes, so the disk transfer time for each block is 1 msec per 1,000 bytes, which is 1 msec. Additionally, the operating system overhead for each block is 1 msec per 1,000 bytes, which is 1 msec. So the total time required for the file read operation in version 1 is the sum of the disk seek time, disk latency time, disk transfer time, and operating system overhead:\n\ntotal time for version 1 = disk seek time + disk latency time + operating system overhead\n\ntotal time for version 1 = 25 msec + 8 msec + 1 msec per 1,000 bytes (file size in version 1) + 1 msec per 1,000 bytes + 10 msec\n\nNow let's calculate the total time required for the file read operation in version 2. We know that version 2 retrieves blocks of 4,000 bytes, so the disk transfer time for each block is still 1 msec per 1,000 bytes, which is 4 msec. Additionally, the operating system overhead for each block is still 1 msec per 1,000 bytes, which is 1 msec. So the total time required for the file read operation in version 2 is the sum of the disk seek time, disk latency time, disk transfer time, and operating system overhead:\n\ntotal time for version 2 = disk seek time + disk latency time + operating system overhead\n\ntotal time for version 2 = 25 msec + 8 msec + 4 msec + 1 msec per 1,000 bytes + 1 msec per 1,000 bytes + 10 msec\n\nComparing the total times required for the file read operation in version 1 and version 2, we can see that the time required by version 2 is approximately three times longer than the time required by version 1. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 1:3.5.",

Purely segmented memory systems divide memory into fixed-size segments, also known as frames or page frames. Each frame has the same size, and the operating system allocates memory in multiples of the segment size. Therefore, (I) correctly describes a property of a purely segmented memory system.\n\n(II) It permits implementation of virtual memory: This statement is incorrect when referring to a purely segmented memory system. Virtual memory is a technique used to simulate the concept of extended memory beyond the physical memory size available in the computer system. This technique involves using disk storage to temporarily hold the memory contents during processing. However, the primary memory in a purely segmented system remains fixed, and there is no concept of virtual memory. Therefore, (II) correctly describes a property of a purely segmented memory system.\n\n(III) It suffers from internal fragmentation: This statement is incorrect when referring to a purely segmented memory system. Internal fragmentation refers to the situation where memory is allocated in an inefficient manner, resulting in unused memory space within a single frame. However, with segments of fixed sizes, the operating system can efficiently allocate memory, minimizing the occurrence of internal fragmentation. Therefore, (III) incorrectly describes a property of a purely segmented memory system.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is (A) I only, as it correctly describes the property of a purely segmented memory system by stating that it divides memory into units of equal size.",
