            "model_answer": "(A) True, True\n\nExplanation:\nStatement 1 is true because linear regression has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators. This is because in regression, the mean squared error decreases as the number of observations increases, and linear regression provides the best-fit line with the least possible error.\n\nStatement 2 is also true because the coefficients assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative because AdaBoost selects classifiers with smaller misclassification errors and weighs them with greater emphasis in the final output. This ensures that the algorithm is positive and minimizes the error rate. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) True, True.",
