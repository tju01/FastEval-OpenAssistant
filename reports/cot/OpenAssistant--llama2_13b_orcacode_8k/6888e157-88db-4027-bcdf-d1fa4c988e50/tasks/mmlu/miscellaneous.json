            "model_answer": "Based on the given scenario, the instructional strategy that best describes the teacher's approach would be (D) Introduction-Body-Conclusion strategy. \n\nIn the teacher's instruction, they present several examples of short stories to the students and work with them to identify defining characteristics of the genre. This approach falls under the Introduction-Body-Conclusion (IBC) instructional strategy.\n\nThe Introduction-Body-Conclusion strategy is a common approach in instruction, especially in writing units. It involves presenting an introduction to the topic at the beginning, followed by the main body of information, and concluding with a summary or synthesis of the information presented.\n\nIn the given scenario, the teacher presents the students with several examples of short stories as an introduction to the genre. This helps to familiarize the students with the characteristics of short stories and provides them with a foundation to build upon.\n\nAfter the introduction, the teacher works with the students to identify the defining characteristics of the genre. This is the body of the instruction, where the teacher guides the students in analyzing and discussing the examples of short stories.\n\nFinally, the teacher concludes the lesson by summarizing and synthesizing the information discussed. This helps the students to consolidate their learning and make connections between the different examples of short stories presented.\n\nTherefore, the instructional strategy that best describes the teacher's approach is (D) Introduction-Body-Conclusion strategy.",

William Clark was born on August 1, 1770, in Caroline County, Virginia, and he died on September 1, 1838, in St. Charles, Missouri. They are most famous for leading the Lewis and Clark Expedition, a journey from Missouri to the Pacific Ocean in 1804-1806. \n\nThe prefix \"Lewis and Clark\" refers to this expedition and not to any other early American explorers. Therefore, options A, C, and D are incorrect. \n\nHence, the answer is (B) Meriwether and William.",

Varicella is a viral infection that causes chickenpox. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) the chickenpox virus. \n\nTo arrive at this answer, we can use a process of elimination. We know that varicella is not a fancy pasta or a type of opera, so we can eliminate options (A) and (B). The answer is also not ancient Roman poetry, so we can eliminate option (D). This leaves us with two options, both of which refer to a viral infection that causes chickenpox. Therefore, we can conclude that the correct answer is (C) the chickenpox virus.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine which of the given materials has a resistance that is LEAST affected by temperature changes, we need to analyze their electrical resistivity and temperature coefficient of resistance.\n\n1. Copper (A): Copper is a metallic material that belongs to the group of metals. It is known for its high electrical conductivity and low resistance. However, the electrical resistivity of copper can change with temperature changes.\n\n2. Carbon (B): Carbon is an element found in various forms, including diamond and graphite. It has a unique property of showing different resistivity values depending on its structural arrangements. Carbon has a relatively high resistivity at room temperature but becomes highly conductive when structurally arranged as graphite. The resistivity of graphene, a highly conductive form of carbon, can indeed be influenced by temperature changes.\n\n3. Germanium (C): Germanium is a semiconductor material that belongs to the group of III-V semiconductors. It has a relatively low resistance at room temperature. However, like other semiconductor materials, the electrical resistivity of germanium can vary significantly with temperature changes.\n\n4. Silicon (D): Silicon is a semiconductor material that belongs to the group of IV semiconductors. It has a relatively high resistivity at room temperature. However, the electrical resistivity of silicon can change significantly with temperature changes due to its semiconductor nature.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the material with the least resistance affected by temperature changes is carbon (B). Carbon has the ability to structurally rearrange itself, forming highly conductive forms like graphite, which can effectively overcome the impact of temperature changes on its resistance.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Carbon.",
