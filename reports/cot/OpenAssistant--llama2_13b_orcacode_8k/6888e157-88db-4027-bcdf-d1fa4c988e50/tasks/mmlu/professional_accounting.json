This option is correct as audit sampling involves selecting a subset of items from the total population and testing them as a representative sample. If the auditor has selected a sample that does not accurately reflect the population, then the conclusions drawn from the sample may not be accurate.\n\n(B) Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements. This option is incorrect as it refers to the risk of the auditor not detecting misstatements in financial statements, which is a different type of risk.\n\n(C) Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.

            "model_answer": "The procedure that an auditor would generally perform regarding subsequent events is (A) Inspect inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end.\n\nStep-by-step justification:\n\n1. An auditor's main objective is to provide an opinion on the financial statements of a client, which involves verifying the accuracy and completeness of the financial information presented.\n2. One of the key components of an audit is to identify any significant subsequent events that may have an impact on the financial statements being audited.\n3. A subsequent event is an event or transaction that occurs after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of the financial statements.\n4. Inspection of inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end is a common subsequent event that auditors consider.\n5. This is because the inventory may have been sold during the period being audited, and the revenue from the sale should be recorded in the financial statements.\n6. If the items were not recorded as inventory until after the year end, it could lead to an understatement of revenue in the current period financial statements.\n7. Therefore, an auditor would inspect the inventory to ensure that it was recorded correctly in the financial statements and that the revenue was recorded appropriately.\n8. On the other hand, procedures (B), (C), and (D) are not related to subsequent events.\n9. Testing internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate, reviewing the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end, and comparing the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited, are all procedures that are typically performed at the audit planning and fieldwork stages of the audit process.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what is meant by the \"amortization\" of a bond premium using the straight-line method versus the effective interest method. \n\nThe amortization of a bond premium means that the amount being accrued for interest each period is reduced by the amount of the premium. For example, if a bond is issued at a premium of $100 to par value, then each period $100 less than the actual interest due is recorded as interest expense, so that the premium is effectively reduced over time.\n\nThe straight-line method of amortizing a bond premium is a simplified method that treats the premium as if it were evenly distributed over the life of the bond, rather than accruing at a faster rate early on and a slower rate later on. This can be a good approximation for bonds with long lives and low coupons.\n\nThe effective interest method of amortizing bond premiums is a more complex method that takes into account the actual cash flows of the bond, including both the premium and the coupons. This method results in a more accurate representation of the bond's true cost over time.\n\nGiven that Dean incorrectly used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method to amortize the premium, it follows that the straight-line method will result in an overstatement of the bond's carrying amount because the true expense of interest is not being recognized completely.\n\nOn the other hand, the effects on the retained earnings and interest earnings will depend on whether the bond is still outstanding at June 30 year 12 or has already been paid off. If the bond has not yet been paid off, then the error in amortization will result in an overstatement of retained earnings. However, this overstatement will be offset by an increase in interest earnings, since the actual expense of interest has been understated. If the bond has already been paid off, then there will be no effect on the retained earnings and interest earnings.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is:\n\n(A) Overstated Understated",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) It will be valued at historical cost.\n\nJustification:\n\nWhen a company decides to sell a non-current asset, it is required to classify it as held for sale and measure it at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. In this case, the old building is being actively marketed for sale and is expected to be sold in four months, so it meets the criteria for classification as held for sale. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because the old building is not being sold immediately, but within four months, so it is not yet being actively marketed for sale. Therefore, it cannot be reclassified as an asset held for sale.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because an asset that is classified as an asset held for sale is not considered a current asset. Instead, it is considered a non-current asset.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because even though the old building is being actively marketed for sale and is expected to be sold in four months, it is still classified as an asset held for sale. This means that the company does not expect the building to be sold within one year, so it cannot be classified as a current asset. Additionally, the building is being sold for a price that reflects its fair value, so there is no need to stop depreciation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) It will be valued at historical cost. This is because when an asset is valued at historical cost, it means that the cost of the asset is used as the measure of fair value. Since the building is being sold for a price that reflects its fair value, it is likely that the price will be close to its historical cost. This is supported by the fact that the building is being actively marketed for sale and is expected to be sold in four months, which suggests that the company is confident that it can obtain a fair price for the asset.",

During a tax year, the corporation reported $400,000 in taxable income and distributed a total of $70,000 in cash dividends to its shareholders. Carson accurately reported $28,000 in gross income on Carson\u2019s individual tax return. If the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions to the owners had been proportionate, how much income would Carson have reported on Carson\u2019s individual return?\n\n(A) $28,000\n(B) $132,000\n(C) $160,000\n(D) $188,000",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "If the distributions to the owners had been proportionate, Carson would have received a percentage of the total distribution equal to their percentage of ownership in the company. Since Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock, they would have received a distribution of approximately $28,000 (40% of $70,000). \n\nIf the corporation had been an S corporation, then the distributions would have been treated as a return of capital rather than dividends. This would have reduced Carson's basis in the stock, rather than increasing their taxable income. This would result in a lower overall taxable income for Carson on their individual return. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) $188,000. To arrive at this answer, we need to calculate Carson's basis in the stock after the distribution. Let's assume that Carson initial basis in the stock was $0. After the distribution, Carson's basis would be approximately $28,000 (40% of the distribution). \n\nSince the distribution was treated as a return of capital, Carson's taxable income would be reduced by the same amount as the distribution. Let's assume that Carson's taxable income before the distribution was $160,000. After the distribution, Carson's taxable income would be approximately $180,000 ($160,000 - $20,000). \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) $188,000 ($28,000 - $20,000 + $160,000).",
