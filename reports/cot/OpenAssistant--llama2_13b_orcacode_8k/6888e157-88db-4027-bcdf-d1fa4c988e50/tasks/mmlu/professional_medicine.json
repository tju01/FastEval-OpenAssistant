            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation is compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. \n\nJustification: \n\nThe patient had a pulmonary embolism and was treated with anticoagulant therapy, which can lead to bleeding and other complications such as hematomas. It is possible that the patient had a hematoma that caused compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, resulting in decreased sensation to light touch over a 5 x 5-cm area on the left thigh. \n\nOption (A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization is less likely, as the patient did not report any other neurological symptoms during her hospital stay. \n\nOption (B) Complication of the IVC filter placement is also less likely, as the patient had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital and did not report any other complications related to the filter. \n\nOption (D) Hematoma of the left thigh, while possible, is less specific than option (C) in terms of identifying the underlying cause of the decreased sensation. \n\nTherefore, option (C) compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is the most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation.",

She had been having regular contractions every 4\u00a0minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6\u00a0hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100%\u00a0effaced and 7\u00a0cm dilated.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the information provided:\n\n1. The patient is a 25-year-old gravida 3 para 2 female, which means she is a 25-year-old woman who is 39 weeks pregnant and has given birth twice before.\n\n2. She is admitted to the hospital in active labor, indicating that her contractions are regular.\n\n3. She had been having regular contractions every 4 minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. This suggests a change in the regularity and strength of her contractions.\n\n4. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6 hours, which may indicate that her pain is being managed.\n\n5. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. This indicates that there is no physical obstruction to the delivery of the baby.\n\n6. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated. These are normal findings in active labor.\n\nBased on this information, we can eliminate option (D) primary dysfunctional labor, as there is no indication of primary dysfunction.\n\nNow let's consider the remaining options:\n\n(A) Braxton Hicks contractions: Braxton Hicks contractions are also known as false labor contractions. They are usually irregular, infrequent, and of low intensity. The fact that the patient was having regular contractions in the past and now they are intermittent and weak suggests a potential change in the nature of her contractions.\n\n(B) Lower uterine retraction ring: This is a rare condition where the muscles of the uterus contract more than usual, causing the lower part of the uterus to protrude into the vagina. It can lead to abnormal placental implantation and can sometimes cause pain. Given that the lower part of the uterus is protruding into the vagina, this could be a possibility.\n\n(C) Hypotonic uterine dysfunction: This refers to a condition where the uterus is weak and fails to properly contract during labor. This can result in delayed or prolonged labor. While hypotonic uterine dysfunction is a possibility, it is not the most likely diagnosis based on the current information.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the most likely diagnosis is (B) lower uterine retraction ring.",

            "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of a low-grade fever, cough, and runny nose. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo (p=0.04). Which of the following is the most appropriate interpretation of these study results?\n\n(A) The findings are clinically and statistically significant\n(B) The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant\n(C) The findings are clinically significant but statistically insignificant\n(D) The findings are neither clinically nor statistically significant",

            "model_answer": "The most appropriate interpretation of these study results is (C) The findings are clinically significant but statistically insignificant.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The study results indicate that the mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo.\n2. The difference between the two means (0.3 days) is statistically significant (p<0.05).\n3. This means that there is a statistically significant difference in the mean time for resolution of symptoms between the two groups.\n4. However, the difference is very small (0.3 days), which suggests that the clinical significance of this difference may be minimal.\n5. Therefore, the findings are clinically significant but statistically insignificant. \n\nAs for the final answer, the correct option is not given in the question. However, since the findings are clinically significant but statistically insignificant, it is reasonable to assume that the physician would likely not prescribe the new drug to the boy.",

The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2 months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years. He has been generally healthy. Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3 years. He takes no medications. He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay. Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?\n\n(A) Atrial fibrillation\n(B) Cor pulmonale\n(C) Systemic hypertension\n(D) Tricuspid valve regurgitation",

            "model_answer": "Based on the information provided, the patient has a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces, weak femoral pulses, and a radiofemoral delay. These findings suggest left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) due to the presence of a systolic murmur. LVH can be caused by various underlying cardiac conditions, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long-standing hypertension, or systemic arterial hypertension. \n\nThe ECG also shows left ventricular hypertrophy. This is a further indication that the patient has LVH. LVH can lead to the development of heart failure and arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation. However, the question does not mention anything about atrial fibrillation, so it is not the correct answer.\n\nCor pulmonale is a condition where the right ventricle of the heart becomes enlarged due to increased blood flow through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs. It is commonly associated with severely reduced pulmonary blood flow, such as in cases of severe pulmonary hypertension or severe left-to-right shunt. The patient's medical history does not mention any pulmonary hypertension or shunting, so it is not the correct answer.\n\nSystemic hypertension is a condition where blood pressure in the systemic circulation is abnormally high. The patient's blood pressure is within the normal range, so it is not the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the patient who is at greatest risk for complications is option D) Tricuspid valve regurgitation. Tricuspid valve regurgitation can occur with left ventricular hypertrophy, as the use of inotropic drugs can cause increased flow through the tricuspid valve at the cost of increased pulmonary regurgitation. This can lead to pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, and ultimately, heart failure.",

The patient has full muscle strength, and there is decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger, suggesting that the ulnar nerve is involved. The ulnar nerve is a sensory nerve that innervates the intrinsic muscles of the hand and provides sensory and motor innervation to the medial half of the ring finger and the fifth and fourth digits. The common causes of ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow are compression, overuse, and trauma. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) ulnar nerve at the elbow.",
