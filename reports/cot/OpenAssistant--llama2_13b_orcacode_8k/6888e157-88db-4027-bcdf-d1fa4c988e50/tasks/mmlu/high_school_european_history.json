While it is true that many Enlightenment intellectuals were accomplished scientists, the information given does not mention anything about Voltaire's scientific contributions.\n\n(B) They utilized new methods of communicating their ideas, such as salons and inexpensive printed pamphlets.\nThis option is partially correct.

The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.
