            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) The responsibility to remain sovereign.\n\nTo arrive at this answer, we need to understand what the responsibility to protect entails. The responsibility to protect is a principle in international law that emphasizes the responsibility of states to protect their populations from atrocity crimes, including genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. \n\nThe responsibility to protect has three elements: the responsibility to prevent, the responsibility to react, and the responsibility to rebuild. \n\nThe responsibility to prevent means that states have a duty to take all necessary measures to prevent atrocity crimes from occurring in the first place. \n\nThe responsibility to react means that states must take appropriate actions when such crimes are threatened or occur. \n\nThe responsibility to rebuild means that states must provide assistance to their populations affected by atrocity crimes in order to aid recovery and reconstruction. \n\nNow let's consider the options provided:\n\n(A) The responsibility to prevent. This is an element of the responsibility to protect, as explained above.\n\n(B) The responsibility to react. This is also an element of the responsibility to protect, as explained above.\n\n(C) The responsibility to remain sovereign. This is not an element of the responsibility to protect. In fact, the responsibility to protect emphasizes the responsibility of states to protect their populations, regardless of whether they have sovereignty over the territory where the atrocity crimes are committed. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) The responsibility to remain sovereign.",

            "question": "Can environmental changes be reconciled with national security interests?\n\n(A) Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, leads to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs.\n(B) Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.\n(D) All of these options.",

            "model_answer": "Before answering the question, let's analyze each option one by one:\n\nOption A: This option suggests that environmental challenges can lead to technological advancements that boost military programs. While this may be true in some cases, it is not necessarily a general statement that applies to all environmental changes. Therefore, we cannot conclude that environmental changes can be reconciled with national security interests based solely on this option.\n\nOption B: This option suggests that environmental changes can undermine national security by eroding the economic base of a country and therefore reducing its military capacity. This is a plausible argument, but it does not completely answer the question. Even if environmental changes weaken a country's military capacity, it does not necessarily mean that environmental changes cannot be reconciled with national security interests. So, we cannot conclude that environmental changes cannot be reconciled with national security interests based solely on this option.\n\nOption C: This option suggests that environmental problems encountered by countries are primarily internal, which means that external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern. This is a valid assumption, but it does not directly address whether environmental changes can be reconciled with national security interests. Therefore, we cannot conclude that environmental changes cannot be reconciled with national security interests based solely on this option.\n\nOption D: This option suggests that all of the above options are true. While this may be partially true, it does not answer the question in a clear and concise manner. Therefore, we cannot conclude that environmental changes can be reconciled with national security interests based solely on this option.\n\nBased on the analysis of each option, we can conclude that we cannot definitively say whether environmental changes can be reconciled with national security interests based on the given options.

Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation.

However, the human security concept is based on the idea that all humans have basic needs and rights that should be protected, regardless of their country of origin or affiliation. Therefore, this criticism is unlikely to be correct.\n\n(B) Human security promotes global capitalism.\nThis criticism suggests that the human security concept is focused on profit and the interests of multinational corporations, rather than on the well-being of people. However, the human security concept is based on the idea that all people should be protected from violence, exploitation, and human rights abuses. Therefore, this criticism is unlikely to be correct.\n\n(C) Human security is too broad.\nThis criticism suggests that the human security concept is too broad and that it fails to differentiate between different types of threats to human security. However, the human security concept is based on the idea that security encompasses a range of threats, including violence, human rights abuses, environmental degradation, and other forms of exploitation.

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

As a result, think tanks have shifted their focus from providing policy-relevant research to providing politicization-resistant theory. This is a potential problem for policy because it could lead to a lack of high-quality research that is relevant to policymakers. Additionally, the blurring of institutional boundaries could lead to a loss of independence of think tanks and universities, which could further undermine the quality of research produced and the credibility of the research.
