            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) This type occurs in binary systems.\n\nA type-Ia supernova is a specific type of supernova that occurs when a white dwarf is transferred mass from a companion star. This mass transfer leads to a runaway fusion reaction that causes the white dwarf to explode. As a result, a type-Ia supernova produces a large amount of light and is used as a standard candle to measure distances in the universe.\n\n(B) This type occurs in young galaxies is incorrect. Although type-Ia supernovae are thought to be linked to the formation of galaxies, they do not occur specifically in young galaxies.\n\n(C) This type produces gamma-ray bursts is incorrect. While gamma-ray bursts can be produced by high-energy phenomena such as black holes, they are not directly related to type-Ia supernovae.\n\n(D) This type produces high amounts of X-rays is incorrect. Type-Ia supernovae produce X-rays, but not in high amounts compared to other types of supernovae.",

The object's speed is not directly related to its brightness, so option (A) is also not the correct answer. \n\nTherefore, the only remaining option is (C) - its size. This is because the object's brightness is directly related to its size, as the amount of light it emits is a function of its total area. A larger object will emit more light and therefore appear brighter than a smaller one. \n\nAnswer: (C) Its size.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The sky appears blue due to the atmospheric scattering of light. This scattering occurs because the atmosphere contains small particles, such as gas molecules, water droplets, and dust particles, which are smaller in diameter than the wavelengths of visible light. When light travels through the atmosphere, these particles scatter the light in all directions, sending it back in all directions. This scattering is more efficient for shorter wavelengths, such as blue wavelengths, than for longer wavelengths, such as red wavelengths. As a result, the blue wavelengths are scattered more and more, while the red wavelengths are scattered less and less. This is why the sky appears blue to our eyes. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (C) - Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) After you\u2019ve repeated your experiment many times.\n\nScientific theories are not proven to be correct or false until they have been tested and repeated many times by different researchers under varying conditions. This is because scientific knowledge is built through a process of observation, experimentation, and reproduction. A theory is not considered proven until it has been tested and confirmed many times by different researchers using different methods and materials.\n\nTherefore, option (A) is incorrect because one single experiment is not enough to prove a theory.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to calculate the minimum impact speed of the comet. This is given by the formula:\n\n0 = frac{v^2}{r_e - r_c}\n\nwhere r_e is the radius of the Earth and r_c is the radius of the comet's nucleus. The minimum impact speed occurs when r_c = r_e, so we have:\n\nv_min = sqrt{frac{2GM}{r_e}}\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nNext, we can calculate the kinetic energy of the comet at the time of impact:\n\nKE = 0.5 * m * v^2\n\nUsing the minimum impact speed we calculated earlier, we get:\n\nKE = 0.5 * m * (sqrt{2GM/r_e})^2\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nKE = 0.5 * m * (2GM/r_e)\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total energy released in the impact by adding the kinetic energy to the potential energy of the comet:\n\nTE = -m * (vez)^2 + KE\n\nSubstituting the expressions for v^2 and KE we get:\n\nTE = -m * (-2GM/r_e)^2 + 0.5 * m * (2GM/r_e)\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\nTE = -m * (2GM/r_e^2)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (-14.4 - 168.6) no letter.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) it was broken into hydrogen and oxygen by ultraviolet light and the hydrogen was lost through thermal escape.\n\nMars has a very thin atmosphere that is made up mostly of carbon dioxide. The atmosphere is also stripped away by the solar wind and other mechanisms. As a result, the planet has experienced a severe loss of atmosphere over time. \n\nDuring its early history, Mars is thought to have had a thicker atmosphere and liquid water on its surface. However, the atmosphere gradually thinned and became more extreme, leading to the loss of much of the planet's original water. \n\nIt is thought that much of the early water on Mars was lost through solar wind stripping, thermal escape, and other mechanisms. However, it is believed that a significant portion was broken down into hydrogen and oxygen by ultraviolet light from the sun and then lost through thermal escape. \n\nThis process is similar to what happens on Earth when sunlight interacts with water vapor in the atmosphere. The molecules are split into hydrogen and oxygen, and the hydrogen is lost through thermal escape into space. \n\nTherefore, it is likely that much of Mars' lost water was broken down into hydrogen and oxygen by ultraviolet light and lost through thermal escape, as described in option (B).",

            "correct_answer": 1,

The Earth is estimated to be around 4.6 billion years old, while the Moon is believed to be around 4.5 billion years old. However, the rocks on the Earth's surface are constantly being eroded and replenished by volcanic activity and weathering, making it difficult to determine their actual age. \n\nOn the other hand, the Moon has very few active geological processes, so the rocks on its surface have remained largely undisturbed. This means that by studying lunar rocks, scientists can use radioactive dating techniques to determine their actual age with a high degree of accuracy. \n\nRadioactive dating works by measuring the ratio of stable isotopes to their radioactive isotopes. By comparing the amount of the stable isotope to the amount of the radioactive isotope, scientists can determine when the rock was last exposed to cosmic radiation, which can then be used to calculate its age. \n\nIn the case of the Moon, scientists have used radioactive dating techniques to determine that many of the rocks on the surface are indeed older than those on the Earth's surface. This is supported by the fact that the Moon has more impact craters than the Earth, which further suggests that it is older. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) Radioactive dating of lunar samples shows that they are older.",

The source of the material that causes meteor showers is the gradual disintegration and spread out of sand-sized particles along the orbit of a near-Earth asteroid. When the Earth passes through this orbit, we are bombarded by these particles, which causes a meteor shower. This disintegration and spreading out process takes place over a period of millions or billions of years, resulting in a trail of particles that follows the asteroid's orbit. As the Earth passes through this trail, the particles collide with our atmosphere, creating the bright streaks of light that we see in meteor showers.
