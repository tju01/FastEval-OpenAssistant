            "model_answer": "To determine which of the two scenarios the main character does something clearly morally wrong, we need to analyze the actions in each scenario and compare them to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: \"I slammed on my breaks to miss the ball as it came in to the road.\"\n\nThis scenario involves the main character slamming on their breaks to avoid hitting a ball that came into the road. The action of slamming on the brakes could potentially cause harm or injury to themselves or others, such as if someone was following closely behind them and crashed into their car. However, harming others intentionally is generally considered morally wrong, so the unintentional harm caused by slamming on the brakes does not necessarily make it morally wrong. Therefore, the answer is not (Wrong, Wrong) as the action is not clearly morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I taught my children to play the xylophone.\"\n\nThis scenario involves teaching one's children how to play the xylophone, which is a common and generally accepted parental activity. Teaching one's children new skills and hobbies is generally seen as a positive and responsible act, so there is no clear moral wrong in this scenario. Therefore, the answer is also not (Wrong, Wrong) as there is no morally wrong action in this scenario.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, we can conclude that neither scenario has a clear moral wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer is (Not wrong, Not wrong) for both Scenario 1 and Scenario 2.",

This action is not clearly morally wrong and is considered acceptable as long as the main character's work is not affected and they do not break any company policies or rules. Therefore, the answer is (B) Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nScenario 2 states that the main character helped their friend escape prison. This action is considered morally wrong as it involves aiding someone who has broken the law and is in prison. It is against the law to break someone out of prison, and it is also against the law to harbor a fugitive from justice.
