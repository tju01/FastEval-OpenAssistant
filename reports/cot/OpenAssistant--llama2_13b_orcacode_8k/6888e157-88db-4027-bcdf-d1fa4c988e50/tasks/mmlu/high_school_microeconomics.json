            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) total revenue is equal to total cost. \n\nMarginal revenue is the change in total revenue that arises from a small increase in total output. It is represented by the demand curve, which shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded. Marginal cost is the change in total cost that arises from a small increase in total output. It is represented by the supply curve, which shows the relationship between cost and quantity supplied.\n\nAt the point where total revenue is equal to total cost, the demand curve and the supply curve are parallel to each other. This means that the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied, and there is no surplus or shortage of goods. At this point, the marginal revenue curve intersects the marginal cost curve, indicating that the production is efficient and profitable. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) total revenue is equal to total cost.",

            "model_answer": "To determine what the firm should do, we need to analyze the given information and consider the marginal product of labor and capital. \n\nLet's start with the given prices of labor and capital. The price of labor is $2, and the price of capital is $1. This means that the firm will incur a cost of $2 per unit of labor and $1 per unit of capital.\n\nNext, let's consider the marginal product of labor and capital. The marginal product of labor is 200, which means that an additional unit of labor increases the firm's output by 200 units. On the other hand, the marginal product of capital is 50, indicating that an additional unit of capital increases the firm's output by 50 units.\n\nNow, let's think about the options provided:\n\n(A) Increase capital and decrease labor so that the marginal product of capital falls and the marginal product of labor rises.\nIn this case, by increasing capital, we are hoping to increase the marginal product of capital while decreasing labor to increase the marginal product of labor. This means that the firm would want to invest in more capital (decreasing labor) to increase its overall productivity and profits.\n\n(B) Increase capital and decrease labor so that the marginal product of capital rises and the marginal product of labor falls.\nThis option is similar to option (A), but it suggests decreasing labor first, followed by increasing capital. This approach would prioritize increasing capital over decreasing labor.\n\n(C) Decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of capital rises and the marginal product of labor falls.\nBy decreasing capital and increasing labor, we are hoping to decrease the marginal product of capital and increase the marginal product of labor. This approach would prioritize increasing labor over decreasing capital.\n\n(D) Decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of capital falls and the marginal product of labor rises.\nThis option is similar to option (C), but it suggests decreasing capital first, followed by increasing labor. This approach would prioritize increasing labor over decreasing capital.\n\nBased on the given information, we can conclude that option (A) is the most appropriate course of action for the firm to pursue. By increasing capital and decreasing labor, the firm can aim to increase the marginal product of capital and labor simultaneously, leading to increased productivity and profitability.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

            "model_answer": "Option (B) is correct. At a Nash equilibrium, neither party has an incentive to deviate from his or her strategy. This means that both players are playing optimally, taking into account the strategies of the other player. If either player were to switch strategies, the other player would have an incentive to switch their own strategy to counter the first player, potentially leading to a better outcome for both players. Therefore, neither party has an incentive to deviate from their strategy at a Nash equilibrium. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because it refers to the price equilibrium, not the Nash equilibrium. The intersection of the supply and demand curves at the price equals the market equilibrium price, but it is not necessarily at a Nash equilibrium. \n\nOption (C) is incorrect because it refers to an intermediate equilibrium in perfect competition, not a Nash equilibrium. \n\nOption (D) is incorrect because if the equilibrium is unstable, it is not a Nash equilibrium.

In other words, it measures how sensitive the demand for one good is to changes in the price of the other good.\n\nIf the cross-price elasticity between two goods is positive, it means that they are substitutes. This means that if the price of one good goes up, consumers will switch to the other good instead. If the cross-price elasticity is negative, it means that they are complements, meaning that if the price of one good goes up, consumers will buy less of the other good.\n\nIn this case, since the cross-price elasticity is +2.0, it means that goods X and Y are substitutes.

This creates a situation where the market does not reflect the true societal cost or benefit of the good or service, leading to an inefficient allocation of resources.\n\nIn such a situation, the price of the good or service may be higher or lower than the socially optimal price, but the societal benefit is not maximized. This occurs because the market does not account for the externality, which means that the cost or benefit to society is not reflected in the market price.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) results in an equilibrium that does not maximize the total benefit to society.",

This is because firms that collude may agree to limit their production levels, reducing competition and allowing them to charge higher prices. This can result in a higher price for consumers, which can harm both consumers and society as a whole.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The demand curve facing an oligopolist when rival firms follow a price decrease but not a price increase is likely to be highly elastic. To understand why, we need to consider how an oligopolist's decision to decrease prices will affect its competitors. \n\nIf a firm decreases prices in an oligopolistic market, its competitors are likely to see a sales increase as consumers switch to its products. However, they are also likely to feel pressured to lower their own prices in order to maintain their market share. This means that the total revenue of all firms in the market will decrease, despite the fact that some individual firms may see a slight increase in sales. \n\nBecause of this, the demand curve facing an oligopolist in this situation is likely to be highly elastic. This means that a small change in price will result in a large change in quantity demanded. In other words, a small decrease in price will lead to a large increase in sales, as consumers switch to the firm's products in response to the lower prices. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (C) Highly elastic demand curve.",

Investments in human capital, such as education and training, can result in higher wages.\n\n(D) Racial discrimination - This is not a basis for a wage differential.

While these factors can contribute to a firm's ability to earn profits, they are not necessarily required for profitability. Therefore, we can eliminate this option as well.\n\nOption (C) suggests that these factors are all sources of elastic demand. However, this is not necessarily correct. For example, economies of scale may not necessarily affect the elasticity of demand. Therefore, we can eliminate this option.\n\nOption (D) suggests that these factors are all barriers to entry. While this is partially true, not all of these factors are necessarily barriers to entry. For example, a patent may allow a firm to charge a premium for its product, but it may not necessarily prevent other firms from entering the market.
