Then, we move on to the next prime number (3, 5, 7, etc.) and repeat the process. \n\nFor example, let's start with number 392: \n\n392 / 2 = 196 \n196 / 2 = 98 \n98 / 2 = 49 \n49 / 2 = 24 \n24 / 2 = 12 \n12 / 2 = 6 \n6 / 2 = 3 \n3 / 2 = 1 \n1 / 2 = 0 (quotient is not a whole number, but we're done with prime factors now) \n\nSo the prime factors of 392 are 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, and 3. \n\nNext, we check if the square of each prime factor is also a factor of the number: \n\n2^2 = 4 (not a factor of 392) \n3^2 = 9 (not a factor of 392) \n2^3 = 8 (not a factor of 392) \n3^3 = 27 (not a factor of 392) \n3^2 * 3^1 * 3^0 = 27 (not a factor of 392) \n2^2 * 2^1 * 2^0 = 16 (not a factor of 392) \n2^1 * 2^0 = 4 (not a factor of 392) \n\nSince none of the squares of the prime factors are factors of 392, 392 is not a powerful number. \n\nNow let's move on to number 336: \n\n336 / 2 = 168 \n168 / 2 = 84 \n84 / 2 = 42 \n42 / 2 = 21 \n21 / 2 = 10 \n10 / 2 = 5 \n5 / 2 = 2 \n2 / 2 = 1 \n1 / 2 = 0 (quotient is not a whole number, but we're done with prime factors) \n\nSo the prime factors of 336 are 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, and 2. \n\nNext, we check if the square of each prime factor is also a factor of the number: \n\n2^2 = 4 (not a factor of 336) \n3^2 = 9 (not a factor of 336) \n2^3 = 8 (not a factor of 336) \n3^3 = 27 (not a factor of 336) \n3^2 * 3^1 * 3^0 = 27 (not a factor of 336) \n2^2 * 2^1 * 2^0 = 16 (not a factor of 336) \n2^1 * 2^0 = 4 (not a factor of 336) \n\nSince none of the squares of the prime factors are factors of 336, 336 is not a powerful number. \n\nMoving on to number 300: \n\n300 / 2 = 150 \n150 / 2 = 75 \n75 / 2 = 37 \n37 / 2 = 18 \n18 / 2 = 9 \n9 / 2 = 4 \n4 / 2 = 2 \n2 / 2 = 1 \n1 / 2 = 0 (quotient is not a whole number, but we're done with prime factors) \n\nSo the prime factors of 300 are 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5, and 5. \n\nNext, we check if the square of each prime factor is also a factor of the number: \n\n2^2 = 4 (not a factor of 300) \n5^2 = 25 (not a factor of 300) \n2^3 = 8 (not a factor of 300) \n5^3 = 125 (not a factor of 300) \n5^2 * 5^1 * 5^0 = 125 (not a factor of 300) \n2^2 * 2^1 * 2^0 = 16 (not a factor of 300) \n2^1 * 2^0 = 4 (not a factor of 300) \n\nSince none of the squares of the prime factors are factors of 300, 300 is not a powerful number. \n\nFinally, we move on to number 297: \n\n297 / 2 = 148 \n148 / 2 = 74 \n74 / 2 = 37 \n37 / 2 = 18 \n18 / 2 = 9 \n9 / 2 = 4 \n4 / 2 = 2 \n2 / 2 = 1 \n1 / 2 = 0 (quotient is not a whole number, but we're done with prime factors) \n\nSo the prime factors of 297 are 2, 2, 2, 3, 13, 13, and 13. \n\nNext, we check if the square of each prime factor is also a factor of the number: \n\n2^2 = 4 (not a factor of 297) \n3^2 = 9 (not a factor of 297) \n2^3 = 8 (not a factor of 297) \n3^3 = 27 (not a factor of 297) \n3^2 * 3^1 * 3^0 = 27 (not a factor of 297) \n2^3 = 8 (not a factor of 297) \n2^3 * 2^1 * 2^0 = 16 (not a factor of 297) \n2^2 * 2^0 = 16 (not a factor of 297) \n2^1 * 2^0 = 4 (not a factor of 297) \n\nSince none of the squares of the prime factors are factors of 297, 297 is not a powerful number. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: \n\n(C) 300",

We also know that $f(x)$ passes through $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$.\n\nNow, let's focus on $f(1)$. We can use the property of strictly convex functions to find the possible range of values for $f(1)$. \n\nFirst, we know that $f(1)$ must be less than $f(2)$ because $f(1)<f(2)$ since the endpoints of the line segment lie on the curve. \n\nSecond, we can use the triangle inequality to compare $f(1)$ with $f(2)$. The triangle inequality states that if $a < b < c$, then $a + c > b$. Therefore, we can conclude that $f(1) + f(2) > f(1 + f(2))$. \n\nThird, we can apply the triangle inequality again to compare $f(1 + f(2))$ with $f(3)$. We get that $f(1 + f(2)) + f(3) > f(1 + f(2) + f(3))$, which means $f(1 + f(2)) > f(1 + f(2) + f(3))$. \n\nPutting all of this together, we can conclude that $f(1) < f(1 + f(2)) < f(1 + f(2) + f(3))$, which means $f(1) < f(1 + f(2)) < f(1 + f(2) + f(3)) < 2 + 5 + 9 < 17$.
