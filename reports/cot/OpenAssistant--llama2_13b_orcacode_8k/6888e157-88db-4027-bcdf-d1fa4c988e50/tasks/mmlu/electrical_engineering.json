            "model_answer": "The potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement is more accurate than direct measurement using a voltmeter because it loads the circuit moderately. \n\nTo understand this statement, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. What are the two methods being compared?\n   - The potentiometer method and the direct measurements using a voltmeter.\n\n2. What is the difference between the two methods?\n   - The potentiometer method loads the circuit moderately, while the direct measurement using a voltmeter does not load the circuit at all.\n\n3. Why is loading the circuit important for accuracy?\n   - Loading the circuit means introducing a small resistance in the circuit, which affects the reading of the voltmeter. With the potentiometer method, the voltage is measured by setting a known resistance (the potentiometer) in series with the circuit. This known resistance acts as a voltage divider, splitting the voltage across the circuit into smaller fractions.\n\n4. What is a \"moderate\" loading?\n   - A \"moderate\" loading means that the known resistance (potentiometer) is in a range that does not significantly affect the overall impedance of the circuit. This allows for more accurate measurements than simply probing the circuit with a directly connected voltmeter.\n\n5. In comparison, what does direct measurement using a voltmeter do?\n   - Direct measurement using a voltmeter does not load the circuit at all. This means that the circuit is not intentionally introduced any resistance, and the reading of the voltmeter is solely based on the voltage across the circuit.\n\n6. How does the potentiometer method compare to the direct measurement using a voltmeter?\n   - The potentiometer method, with a moderate loading, provides more accurate voltage measurements compared to direct measurement using a voltmeter without any loading.",

            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to first find the current-voltage characteristics of the circuit. We can do this by taking the derivative of the voltage and setting it equal to zero to find the rate of change in voltage. Once we have the current-voltage characteristics, we can then use Ohm's Law to find the range of firing angle control.\n\nLet's start by assuming that the resistance is R and the time period of the waveform is T. The single-phase nature of the circuit means that we only need to analyze one half-cycle of the waveform. We can rewrite the source voltage as:\n\nV = 400 sin(314 T)\n\nThe counter-emf is given as 200 V, which means we can use this as the initial voltage for our analysis. We will call the time of the peak voltage as t, where V(t) = 400 sin(314 T) = 200 V. We can then use Ohm's Law to find the circuit current:\n\nI = V/R = 200 V / R\n\nTo find the current-voltage characteristics, we take the derivative of voltage with respect to time:\n\nI' = V'/R = (-314 T) * 200 V / R\n\nNow we have a second-order differential equation:\n\nI'' - 314 T * I' + 400 * R I = 0\n\nWe can assume R and T are constant, leaving us with a first-order homogeneous linear differential equation that can be solved using the method of Frobenius. The solution is:\n\nI(t) = [C1 e^(314 T t) sin(314 T t) + C2 cos(314 T t)] / R\n\nThe initial conditions are:\n\nI(t = 0) = 0\nI'(t = 0) = 0\n\nThis gives us:\n\nC1 = C2 = 0\n\nSo the circuit current is zero everywhere except for the positive peak of the waveform:\n\nI(t = t) = V(t) / R = 200 V / R\n\nWe can use Ohm's Law to rearrange the equation for circuit current:\n\nI(t) = V(t) / R = [200 V - 200 V sin(314 T t)] / R\nI(t) = -V(t) / R * sin(314 T t) * cos(314 T t)\n\nThis means that the circuit current switches polarity at the negative peak of the waveform. The range of firing angle control can be found by analyzing the behavior of the circuit current at the positive and negative peaks of the waveform.\n\nAt the positive peak of the waveform (t = 0), the circuit current is simply:\n\nI(t = 0, positive peak) = 200 V / R = Ip (Ip is the amplitude of the circuit current)\n\nWe can also assume that the circuit current is zero everywhere else, since the circuit is only switched on at the positive peak by the single-phase, one-pulsen controller. This means that the range of firing angle control is:\n\nI(t, t) - I(t = t, positive peak) = 0 - Ip = -Ip\n\nI(t, t) is the current at the negative peak of the waveform. We can find this by plugging in t = 0 for the negative peak instead:\n\nI(t = 0, negative peak) = -200 V / R = Ip\n\nThis means that the range of firing angle control is from negative peak current to positive peak current:\n\n0 < I < Ip\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) 60\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand how electric forces behave in such a scenario. \n\nIn this scenario, we have two metal plates that are infinitely large and parallel to each other. These metal plates are charged with equal surface charge densities of the same polarity. \n\nWhen we have two charged objects, the electric field created by each object will add up to produce the total electric field. As the plates are parallel, the electric field lines will be perpendicular to the plates and will be equally directed from both plates. \n\nLet's consider a field point in the gap between the plates, which is a point on the line joining the centers of the two plates. At this point, the electric field will be the vector sum of the electric fields produced by each plate. \n\nWe know that the electric field produced by a uniformly charged flat plate is given by $E_{parallet} = \\frac{Q}{2\\pi \\epsilon_{0}d}$, where $Q$ is the charge, $d$ is the distance from the plate, and $\\epsilon_{0}$ is the electric constant. \n\nSince both plates have the same surface charge density, the electric field produced by one plate is the same as the electric field produced by the other plate. \n\nNow, let's calculate the total electric field at the given field point. \n\nThe total electric field is determined by the sum of the electric fields produced by each plate. Therefore, the electric field at the field point in the gap between the plates is: \n\n$E_{total} = E_{plate1} + E_{plate2} = \\frac{Q}{2\\pi \\epsilon_{0}r} + \\frac{Q}{2\\pi \\epsilon_{0}r} = 2E_{parallet} = \\frac{2Q}{2\\pi \\epsilon_{0}r}$ \n\nNow, substitute the values $Q$ and $r$ into the equation above to get the final answer: \n\n$E_{total} = \\frac{2Q}{2\\pi \\epsilon_{0}(r_{1/2})} = \\frac{Q}{2\\pi \\epsilon_{0}r_{1/2}}$ \n\nwhere $r_{1/2}$ is the distance between the centers of the two plates, which is equal to half of the total separation between the plates. \n\nNow, we can compare this result with the options given in the question: \n\n(A) If the electric field is the same as that produced by one plate, then $E_{total} = E_{parallet} = \\frac{Q}{2\\pi \\epsilon_{0}r}$. \n\n(B) If the electric field is double the field produced by one plate, then $E_{total} = 2E_{parallet} = \\frac{2Q}{2\\pi \\epsilon_{0}r}$. \n\n(C) If the electric field is dependent on coordinates of field points, then we cannot conclude anything about the total electric field or the contribution of each plate. \n\n(D) If the total electric field is zero, then $E_{total} = 0$, which is not the case here. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) double the field produced by one plate.",
