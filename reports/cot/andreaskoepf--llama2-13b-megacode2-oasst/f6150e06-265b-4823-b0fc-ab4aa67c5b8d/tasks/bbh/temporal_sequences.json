Since we don't know how long it took her to get ready and go to the construction site, we know that Sarah could have arrived at the construction site after 6 am.\n\nAt 8 am, Nancy saw Sarah fixing their computer at the electronic store. This means that between 6 am and 8 am, there was a possibility that Sarah went to the construction site before visiting the electronic store.\n\nBetween 8 am and 2 pm, Sarah was busy attending activities such as visiting the electronic store (8 am to 2 pm) and then driving to the water park (2 pm to 3 pm). During this time, she could not have been at the construction site since it was closed after 8 pm.\n\nFrom 3 pm to 4 pm, Kimberly saw Sarah buying clothes at the mall.

You know that Leslie was at school between 6pm and 10pm, so that is one window of time. However, this window is already inclusive of time so you need to remove the bottom of the window (10pm) to get the actual time Leslie would have left school. We are still left with a few options so we move on to the next earliest time.\n\nRichard saw Leslie at the electronics store between 5am and 7am. This is during the first window and is therefore already accounted for. The next window is 7am to 11am. Leslie was at school from 6pm to 10pm, so she had to be there for at least 4 hours, removing 4 hours from the end of the window (11am) we get 7am, which is when David saw Leslie at school. We already accounted for the time Richard saw Leslie at the electronics store, so we remove that time from the window (7am to 11am) to get the actual time Leslie would have left school.\n\nThis gives us the window from 7am to 10am. However, we need to remove Leslie's time spent at the electronics store during this time. We know that Richard saw Leslie at the electronics store between 5am and 7am, so we subtract 2 hours from the beginning of the window (7am) to get 5am.

Given that on their current time they could not have acquired a phone, clothes or sat on a rooftop simultaneously in different places, nor bought at the bakery for 18 hours, the bakery must have been opened after 9pm. However, since it was closed by 9pm, the latest Samantha could have gone to the bakery was 8pm.
