            "correct_answer": "(C)",
            "model_answer": "(A) Orlando\n\nHere is how I arrived at the answer. \n\n1. First, we should note that each of the four movies mentioned is a very different type of cinema. Schindler's List is a Holocaust drama, Braveheart is an historical epic, The Silence of the Lambs is a psychological thriller, and finally Tombstone is a Western. \n\n2. Therefore, when attempting to find a movie that is similar to all four of these, rather than simply finding movies from the same genre, we should be looking for movies that share common thematic elements. \n\n3. One of the most common themes amongst historical and epic story telling is the exploration of identity and transformation. \n\n4. Orlando, as soon as you mentioned it to me, I recognized immediately as a movie that explores this theme in a powerful way.\n\n5. Set in England during the rise of the Enlightenment, Orlando is a biographical fantasy film about a man who is transformed into a woman for three centuries, who proceeds to live through significant historical events as a woman. \n\n6. Therefore, out of the four provided options, Orlando is the film that is most similar to the four listed in content. \n\n7. Even if it was not, in theme it is adjacent to all four, as they all explore societal and internal transformation. Therefore, even apart from its similarities in plot, Orlando is closer to the four listed than the other answers in thematic similarity. \n\nTherefore the answer is (A) Orlando.",

Toy Story and The Mask have Comedy but are not focused on action.\n- Superhero: It has a protagonist with superhuman abilities (an ex-convict with extensive fighting skills), similar to Batman, but not a Superhero movie. \n- Animated: Exit Wounds is not animated. \n\nSo, Exit Wounds partially aligns with three characteristics (Action/Comedy, Superhero), but not all four.\n\n(B) Punch-Drunk Love:\n- Action/Comedy: Involves action (violence, fighting) but has a comedic tone. Toy Story and The Mask have Comedy but are not primarily focused on action.\n- Superhero: It has a protagonist with superhuman abilities (an unassuming man suddenly acquires fighting skills), similar to Batman, but not exactly a Superhero movie.\n- Animated: It is not animated.\n\nPunch-Drunk Love aligns with three of the four characteristics (Action/Comedy, Superhero), just like Toy Story, The Mask, and Batman.\n\n(C) Seeking Justice:\n- Action/Comedy: There are action scenes, but the movie leans more towards the action genre than comedy. Toy Story and The Mask have Comedy but are not primarily focused on action.\n- Superhero: It has a protagonist with superhuman abilities (a vigilante), similar to Batman, but not exactly a Superhero movie. \n- Animated: It is not animated.\n\nSeeking Justice aligns only marginally with two of the four characteristics (Action, Superhero).\n\n(D) Pretty Woman:\n- Action/Comedy: The movie is a romantic comedy, not focused on action. Toy Story and The Mask have Comedy but are not primarily focused on action.\n- Superhero: It has no superhuman abilities or action elements similar to Batman.\n- Animated: It is not animated.\n\nPretty Woman aligns with none of the four characteristics.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis it can be deduced that **Punch-Drunk Love** (Option B) works best as a combination of genres similar to the mentioned movies.",
