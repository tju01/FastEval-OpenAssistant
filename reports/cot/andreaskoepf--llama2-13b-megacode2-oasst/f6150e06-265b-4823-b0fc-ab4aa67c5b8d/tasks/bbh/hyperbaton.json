            "model_answer": "Alright, we are going to determine which sentence has the correct adjective order by following these steps:\n\n1. Read both sentences and note the adjectives' order.\n2. Determine the correct order of adjectives based on the standard English adjective order.\n3. Compare the order of adjectives in both sentences with the correct adjective order.\n4. Identify the correct option.\n\nLet's follow the steps:\n\n1. First, let's read and analyze the two sentences.\n    a) Sitio A: midsize old grey Brazilian sweater\n    b) Sitio B: midsize grey Brazilian old sweater\n   \n2. The standard English adjective order is as follows:\n    - Opinion adjectives (e.g., beautiful)\n    - Size adjectives (e.g., small)\n    - Shape adjectives (e.g., square or curved)\n    - Age adjectives (e.g., old or new)\n    - Color or Material adjectives (e.g., green or cotton)\n    - Purpose adjectives (e.g., swimsuit)\n    - Proper adjectives (e.g., American)\n    - Origin adjectives (e.g., Brazilian)\n\nBased on this order, the correct adjective order for the sentence should be: 'Brazilian old grey midsize sweater'\n\n3.Now let's compare the order of adjectives in both sentences with the correct adjective order that we just determined:\n\n    a) Sitio A: midsize old grey Brazilian sweater\n    b) Sitio B: midsize grey Brazilian old sweater\n   \nAs we can see, the order of adjectives doesn't match the correct English Adjective Order.\n\n4. So, sitio A: midsize old grey Brazilian sweater is a correct sentence. The final answer is (A).",

Adjective order generally follows nationality, size, shape, color, origin/material, quality, purpose and common adjectives come before proper adjectives. \n2. In both sentences, the size of the cat comes first. An adjective describing the size of a cat should come before the adjective describing its origin. For this reason, \"midsize\" should come before \"gray\" and before \"Mexican\".\n3. In sentence (A), the order of adjectives would be: midsize, gray, Mexican, rubber, walking, cat. This order satisfies the general adjective ordering principles.\n4. In sentence (B), the order of adjectives is: midsize, gray, Mexican, rubber, walking, cat.\n\nSince both options have adjectives in the correct order, both inputs have the correct adjective order. So both options give the same final letter 'c' as a single letter with parenthesis.",

This order can be interpreted as follows: first, the noun is described in terms of its age (ancient); then, it is described in terms of its mystery (mysterious); next, it is described in terms of its color (yellow); following that, it is described in terms of its action (walking); and finally, it is described in terms of its type (cat).\n\nOption (B): mysterious ancient yellow walking cat\nIn this option, the adjectives are arranged in the following order: mysterious, ancient, yellow, walking, and cat. This order can also be interpreted as follows: first, the noun is described in terms of its mystery (mysterious); then, it is described in terms of its age (ancient); next, it is described in terms of its color (yellow); following that, it is described in terms of its action (walking); and finally, it is described in terms of its type (cat).\n\nBoth option (A) and option (B) have adjective orders that describe the noun in a logical and coherent manner.

If they are two, then \"big\" should come after \"ridiculous\". If it is a single adjective, then \"big\" should come before \"ridiculous\".
