From the given statements, we can deduce that the orange book is to the right of the black book, and the blue book is also to the right of the orange book. Therefore, the orange book is in the second position from the left.\n2. As we have already determined that the orange book is in the second position from the left, we can deduce that the black book must be in the first position from the left.\n3. Therefore, the blue book is in the third position from the left.\n\nHence, the answer is:\n(C) The blue book is the second from the left.",
