The wording here is positive and complimentary.\n\nOption (B): The statement is describing someone as a \"terrible person\" for promoting a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need. The wording here is negative and insulting.\n\nNow, let's think about sarcasm: sarcasm is the use of words to convey a meaning that is opposite to their literal meaning. It is typically used to mock or criticize something.\n\nIn this case, Option (B) uses negative and insulting wording to describe someone for doing something noble and positive (promoting a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need). This contrast between the negative wording and the positive action suggests that the statement is likely sarcastic.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nB",

To do this, let's consider the meaning of each statement and their implications:\n\n(A) This statement implies that the speaker believes the person suggesting that someone should have allowed others to get away after assaulting them is mistaken. This statement expresses disagreement with the idea that it's okay for someone to not defend themselves against an attack.\n\n(B) This statement implies that the speaker agrees with the person who suggested that someone should have allowed others to get away after assaulting them. This statement expresses agreement with the idea that it's okay for someone to not defend themselves against an attack.\n\nNow, based on the meanings of these statements, we can see that option (B) is actually in agreement with the idea that someone should have allowed attackers to get away, while option (A) disagrees with that idea.\n\nTherefore, option (B) is the sarcastic statement because it goes against the expected social norm of defending oneself against an assault and instead agrees with the idea that the person should have just let the attackers get away.\n\nFinal Answer: (B)",
