            "question": "If the frequency of males affected with an X-linked recessive condition in a human population is .10 (one in ten), what will be the expected frequency of affected females?\n\n(A) 0.01\n(B) 0.001\n(C) 0.02\n(D) 0.0001",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to use the principles of genetics and inheritance to determine the expected frequency of affected females.\n\nExplanation:\nX-linked recessive conditions are inherited when an individual inherits two copies of the mutated allele, one from each parent. Since males only have one X chromosome, if they inherit two copies of the mutated allele, they will be affected. Females, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes, and if they inherit two copies of the mutated allele, one of the X chromosomes should \"mask\" the other, so that they will not be affected. However, if a female inherits one copy of the mutated allele from one parent and a normal allele from the other parent, she will be a carrier of the condition.\n\nSince the frequency of males affected with the X-linked recessive condition is 10%, this means that 10% of the male population is heterozygous for the condition (i.e., they carry one copy of the mutated allele and one normal allele). All other males and females in the population are homozygous for the normal allele.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected frequency of carrier females. Since females must inherit a copy of the mutated allele from one parent, 50% of females are expected to inherit a copy of the mutated allele from their father. However, only half of these females will be carriers, because they must also inherit a copy of the normal allele from their mother. Therefore, the expected frequency of affected females is simply twice the frequency of carrier females:\n\nExpected frequency of affected females = 2 * frequency of carrier females\nExpected frequency of affected females = 2 * 0.05\nExpected frequency of affected females = 0.10\n\nSo the answer is:\n(A) 0.01",

            "question": "The pattern of inheritance shown by malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia) is:\n\n(A) autosomal dominant.\n(B) autosomal recessive.\n(C) X-linked dominant.\n(D) X-linked recessive.",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Let us first understand what Malignant Hyperthermia (Hyperpyrexia) is. Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition that is characterized by major motor muscle rigidity, fever, and hypermetabolism. It is caused by a genetic mutation which causes excessive release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells, leading to muscle rigidity and hypermetabolism.\n\nNow let's look at the possible patterns of inheritance:\n\n1. Autosomal dominant gene: Each parent donates one copy of the gene. If the person inherits two copies of the gene, one from each parent, then the person will have the disorder. An individual with one copy of the gene is called a carrier and will have no symptoms, but can pass the gene onto offspring. An example of an autosomal dominant gene is sickle cell anemia. In this condition, a person only needs to inherit one copy of the gene from one parent to have the disease.\n\n2. Autosomal recessive gene: Each parent donates one copy of the gene, but in order for the child to have the disorder, they must inherit two copies of the gene \u2013 one from each parent. An example of an autosomal recessive gene is cystic fibrosis. An individual with just one copy of the gene is a carrier, and their children have a 25% chance of inheriting two copies and having CF, while their siblings have a 50% chance of being carriers.\n\n3. X-linked dominant gene: This is a rare pattern, and it occurs when a gene is located on the X chromosome and inherited from a father. In this case, the father must be affected for his son to be affected, while daughters can be carriers but generally won't have the condition. There are no examples of X-linked dominant genes in human diseases, as all X-linked genes are typically recessive.\n\n4. X-linked recessive gene: This occurs when a gene responsible for a genetic disease is located on the X chromosome, and a female must inherit two copies of the gene \u2013 one from each parent \u2013 in order to have the disease. Males only need one copy of the gene to have the disorder, as they have only one X chromosome. Examples of X-linked recessive genes include hemophilia and red-green color blindness.\n\nBased on the above information, we can eliminate options (B) and (D), as they are not consistent with what we know about the inheritance of MH. Judging from the available information, MH seems to exhibit autosomal dominant inheritance, which is consistent with option (A). Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(A) autosomal dominant.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Let's analyze each option one by one.\n\n(A) This option suggests that mapping of human chromosomes has been restricted to sex chromosomes due to small family sizes. This is not accurate since the mapping of chromosomes includes all the chromosomes and it is not restricted to sex chromosomes only. So, this option can be ruled out.\n\n(B) Mapping of human chromosomes has been successful due to large numbers of DNA markers becoming available. This statement makes sense as DNA markers are essential in mapping chromosomes. Therefore, this option seems to be correct. \n\n(C) Mapping of human chromosomes has determined that the number of linkage groups is about twice the number of chromosomes. This statement is not accurate because linkage groups are not directly proportional to the number of chromosomes. So this option can be ruled out.\n\n(D) Mapping of human chromosomes has demonstrated that almost all of the DNA is involved in coding for genes. This statement is not accurate because only a small percentage of the DNA is involved in coding for genes. The majority of the genome is non-coding DNA so this option can be ruled out.\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct answer is (B) as it accurately describes the success of mapping human chromosomes due to the availability of large numbers of DNA markers.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, let's understand what exon skipping means. Exon skipping is a type of gene therapy that involves altering the normal splicing of pre-mRNA to include exons that are normally skipped over during mRNA processing. This can result in the production of a functional protein even when there is a mutation in the coding region of a gene.\n\nNow let's analyze each of the answer choices:\n\n(A) Nonsense mutations occur when there is a stop codon introduced in the coding region of a gene, resulting in a truncated protein that is often nonfunctional. Exon skipping can help bypass the stop codon and allow for the production of a functional protein.\n\n(B) Regulatory mutations occur in the control regions of a gene, such as promoters or enhancers, and can affect gene expression. These mutations are not directly related to exon skipping.\n\n(C) RNA processing mutations occur in the regions of pre-mRNA that are involved in splicing. These mutations can result in abnormal splicing and the inclusion or exclusion of exons, which is the basis of exon skipping therapy.\n\n(D) Silent mutations occur in non-coding regions of the DNA and do not alter the sequence of the protein being produced. These mutations are not directly related to exon skipping.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) RNA processing mutations.",
