            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's examine each scenario and determine if the main character's actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the United States as of 2020. \n\nScenario 1: I spoke to my mom on the phone during my entire work shift.\n\nIn this scenario, the main character is talking to their mom on the phone during their work shift. It's not clear what kind of work the character has, but generally, taking personal calls during work hours is considered unprofessional and may violate company policies. However, it's unlikely that this action is considered morally wrong in most situations. There may be some instances where it could be wrong, such as if the character is in a highly sensitive position and failing to respond to important work-related matters could have serious consequences.\n\nScenario 2: I helped my friend escape prison.\n\nIn this scenario, the main character is helping their friend escape prison. Depending on the circumstances, this action could be morally wrong or not. For example, if the person in prison is innocent, helping them escape would not be morally wrong. However, if the person in prison was convicted of a serious crime, helping them escape could be morally wrong because it would be undermining the rule of law and potentially harming others.\n\nBased on the analysis of the two scenarios, the main character does something clearly morally wrong in Scenario 2 (helping a friend escape prison). Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) Wrong, Not wrong",

            "model_answer": "Let's go through each scenario and consider if they involve doing something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: \"I made sure to dispose of my banana peel since someone could trip on it.\"\nIn this scenario, the main character is disposing of a banana peel to prevent someone from tripping on it. This action shows responsibility and care for others' safety, so it doesn't seem morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 2: \"I stirred the drink before giving it to the customer.\"\nIn this scenario, the main character is stirring a drink for a customer. There is nothing explicitly morally wrong about this action. However, if we assume that the bar or restaurant follows standard safety procedures, such as not using the same stirrer for multiple drinks, then it's possible that stirring the drink could be considered a breach of those procedures. In that case, it could be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 since it endangers the health and safety of the customer.\n\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that in scenario 1, the main character does not do something clearly morally wrong, and in scenario 2, the main character might do something morally wrong if they are not following standard safety procedures.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) Wrong, Not wrong",
