            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To solve this multiple-choice question, let's analyze the given information and options:\n\nInitial sentence: _________, where for example one party possess more resources, unfair distribution... where one party gains more from the relationship, and CSOs being _________, are all limitations and risks of business-CSO collaborations.\n\nThe subject of the sentence are the limitations and risks of business-CSO collaborations.\n\nThe sentence talks about three limitations:\n\n1. Unfair distribution of resources.\n2. One party gains more from the relationship.\n3. CSOs being...\n\nNow let's examine the options:\n\n(A) Power imbalance, Benefits, Hoodwinked\n(B) Power imbalance, Resources, Co-opted\n(C) Informational asymmetries, Benefits, Hoodwinked\n(D) Informational asymmetries, Resources, Co-opted\n\nOption A talks about power imbalance, benefits, and hoodwinked. However, \"hoodwinked\" doesn't fit the context of limitations and risks. Option B talks about power imbalance, resources, and co-opted, which could be a potential answer. Option C talks about informational asymmetries, benefits, and hoodwinked, but still \"hoodwinked\" doesn't fit the context. Option D talks about informational asymmetries, resources, and co-opted, which could also be a potential answer.\n\nNow we need to identify which of the two potential answers (B or D) is more suitable for the context.\n\nThe first limitation mentioned is unfair distribution of resources. This indicates an imbalance in power or resources, which can lead to one party gaining more from the relationship. Among the options, the second part of both options B and D mentions resources. Therefore, both options can potentially fit the first limitation.\n\nHowever, the third limitation mentioned is CSOs being... This part of the sentence suggests that CSOs become something negative as a result of the business-CSO collaboration, which leads to one party gaining more benefits. This aligns better with option B, which mentions benefits being \"co-opted\" (taken over or hijacked for another purpose). Option D mentions benefits as well, but doesn't provide a specific explanation for why CSOs become something negative.\n\nTherefore, among the two potential answers, option (B) Power imbalance, Resources, Co-opted is the most suitable answer.\n\nAnswer: B",

            "question": "Although corporate profit maximization is not directly prescribed by major normative theories to which normative theory is it most similar?\n\n(A) hedonistic utilitarianism\n(B) preference utilitarianism\n(C) The Categorical Imperative\n(D) ethics of care",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(A) Hedonistic utilitarianism.\n\nThe most similar normative theory to corporate profit maximization is hedonistic utilitarianism because both focus on increasing the overall pleasure (or utility) and decreasing the overall pain of individuals involved. Hedonistic utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism, which evaluates actions based on their consequences. In the context of corporate profit maximization, the goal is to maximize profits for shareholders, which often involves increasing the pleasure of customers and reducing the pain of employees and other stakeholders. This aligns with the goal of maximizing overall pleasure (or utility) in hedonistic utilitarianism.\n\n(B) Preference utilitarianism is not as similar, as it focuses on maximizing the preferences of individuals, rather than their overall pleasure or utility. Although profit maximization may increase the preferences of shareholders, it does not necessarily maximize the overall preferences of all stakeholders.\n(C) The Categorical Imperative is not similar, as it is a deontological theory that focuses on following universal moral rules, rather than maximizing consequences.\n(D) Ethics of care is also not similar, as it emphasizes empathy and relationships, rather than maximizing outcomes.",
