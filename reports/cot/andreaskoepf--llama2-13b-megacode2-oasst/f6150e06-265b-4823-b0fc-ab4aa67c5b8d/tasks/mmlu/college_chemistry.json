            "model_answer": "Infrared spectroscopy is useful for determining certain aspects of the structure of organic molecules because (C) most organic functional groups absorb in a characteristic region of the IR spectrum.\n\nIR spectroscopy works by measuring the absorption of IR radiation by a sample. Different chemical bonds absorb IR radiation at specific wavelengths, which generates vibrational energy within the molecule. When the vibration is re-emitted, it generates an IR spectrum that is unique to the chemical composition and structure of the molecule.\n\nOrganic functional groups, such as alkyl, aryl, and carboxyl groups, contain specific types of chemical bonds that absorb IR radiation at characteristic wavelengths. By analyzing the absorption peaks in the IR spectrum, scientists can identify the presence and relative amounts of these functional groups, which provides valuable information about the molecule's structure and composition.\n\nThis is why (A), (B), and (D) are not the correct answers. While all molecular bonds do absorb IR radiation, (B) is not true because IR peak intensities are not directly related to molecular mass. And (D) is not accurate because each element does not absorb at a characteristic wavelength; it is the specific bond types within the molecule that absorb IR radiation at unique wavelengths.",

The J value is the total angular momentum of the coupled radical's spin system.\n\nThe EPR spectrum of a nitronyl nitroxide diradical with J << a will show a single line.

            "model_answer": "Cobalt-60 is a radioactive isotope that is extensively used in medical applications, including cancer treatment. It can be produced by bombarding cobalt-59 with a specific type of radiation. Let's go through the options one by one to determine the correct answer.\n\n(A) Neutrons: Neutrons are subatomic particles with no electric charge. They can interact with the nucleus of an atom, but they cannot penetrate the outer electron cloud. Therefore, neutrons cannot initiate nuclear reactions in cobalt-59 to produce cobalt-60.\n\n(B) Alpha particles: Alpha particles consist of two protons and two neutrons, collectively referred to as an alpha particle. These particles carry a significant amount of mass and charge and have the ability to penetrate matter readily. However, alpha particles cannot cause a transition of an atomic nucleus from one isotope to another. Only certain types of nuclear reactions, involving the conversion of protons to neutrons or vice versa, can produce a new isotope. Alpha particles cannot achieve this.\n\n(C) Beta particles: Beta particles consist of electrons that are emitted from the nucleus of an atom during certain types of radioactive decay. Electrons are lighter and less charged than alpha particles and cannot penetrate matter to a significant extent. Additionally, beta particles alone cannot cause a transition of an atomic nucleus from one isotope to another.\n\n(D) X-rays: X-rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation, characterized by high frequency and energy. They are not capable of causing nuclear reactions or altering the number of protons and neutrons in an atom's nucleus. X-rays can ionize atoms by removing an electron from the outer electron cloud, but this process does not result in the formation of a new isotope.\n\nBased on our analysis of the above options, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) X-rays",
