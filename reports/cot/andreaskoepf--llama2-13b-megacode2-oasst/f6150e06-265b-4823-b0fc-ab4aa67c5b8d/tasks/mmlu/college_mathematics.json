If $G = \\mathbb{Z}/2^4\\mathbb{Z}$, then there is only one element (the identity element). However, $x + x + x + x = 0$ would imply that the identity element is 0, which would mean $G$ would be torsion-free (since the only elements thatwill equal 0 are trivial), but this is not the case. Therefore, this group does not satisfy the equation.\n2. If $G = \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$, then the equation can be rewritten as $0 = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4$, where $x_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.

            "model_answer": "Sure, let's solve this problem step-by-step:\n\nFirst, we need to find the equation of the tangent line at the origin (x=y=0). The equation of the tangent line at a point (x=x0,y=y0) is given by:\n\ndy/dx = (y - y0) / (x - x0)\n\nIn our case, x0 = 0 and y0 = 0, so the equation becomes:\n\ndy/dx = (0 - 0) / (0 - 0) = 0\n\nThis means that the slope of the tangent line at the origin is 0.\n\nNow, we want to find the shortest distance from the curve xy = 8 to the origin. This distance can be found by using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the longest side (hypotenuse) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (squares of the legs):\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nwhere c is the distance from the origin to the curve, a is the distance from the origin to the curve along the x-axis, and b is the distance from the origin to the curve along the y-axis.\n\nSince the curve is given by xy = 8, we can express the other two sides of the equation as:\n\na = |x| = \u221a(2^2 - y^2) = \u221a6 - y^2\nb = |y| = \u221a(8 - x^2) = \u221a(8 - 2^2) = \u221a6 - x^2\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum value of a^2 + b^2. We can do this by differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to y and setting the resulting equation equal to 0:\n\nd(a^2 + b^2)/dy = d(a^2)/dy + d(b^2)/dy = 0\n\nThis means that the derivative of (a^2 + b^2) with respect to y is equal to 0. We can find the derivative by using the chain rule and the fact that the derivative of the square of a function with respect to y is twice the derivative with respect to x:\n\n(d(a^2 + b^2)/dy) = 2 * ((d(a)/dy) * a + (d(b)/dy) * b)\n\nSince d(y)/dy = 1, we have:\n\n(d(a^2 + b^2)/dy) = 2 * ((d(a)/dy) * a + (d(b)/dy) * b)\n\nWe can substitute the expressions for a and b into the above equation:\n\n(d(a^2 + b^2)/dy) = 2 * ((d(\u221a6 - y^2)/dy) * (\u221a6 - y^2) + (d(\u221a6 - x^2)/dy) * (\u221a6 - x^2))\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(d(a^2 + b^2)/dy) = 2 * ((\u2154 - y^2/\u221a6) * (\u221a6 - y^2) + (\u2154 - x^2/\u221a6) * (\u221a6 - x^2))\n\nSince the derivative of the square of a function with respect to x is the same as the derivative of that function with respect to x, we can substitute:\n\n(d(a^2)/dy) = 2 * ((\u2154 - y^2/\u221a6) * (\u221a6 - y^2)) = a * ((\u2154 - y^2/\u221a6) * (\u221a6 - y^2))'\n\nSimilarly, we can substitute:\n\n(d(b^2)/dy) = 2 * ((\u2154 - x^2/\u221a6) * (\u221a6 - x^2)) = b * ((\u2154 - x^2/\u221a6) * (\u221a6 - x^2))'\n\nNow, substitute these expressions back into the above equation and cancel out the common terms to get:\n\n0 = 2 * (a * ((\u2154 - y^2/\u221a6) * (\u221a6 - y^2))' + b * ((\u2162 - x^2/\u221a6) * (\u221a6 - x^2))')\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n0 = (\u2154 - y^2/\u221a6) * (\u221a6 - y^2) + (\u2162 - x^2/\u221a6) * (\u221a6 - x^2)\n\nFactoring out a common factor of \u221a6, we get:\n\n0 = \u221a6 * ((\u2154 - y^2/\u221a6) + (\u2162 - x^2/\u221a6))\n\nDividing both sides by \u221a6, we get:\n\n0 = (\u2154 - y^2/\u221a6) + (\u2162 - x^2/\u221a6)\n\nAdding the two terms, we get:\n\n(\u2154 + \u2162 - y^2/\u221a6 - x^2/\u221a6) = 0\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n(2/\u221a6 - y^2/\u221a6 + 2/\u221a6 - x^2/\u221a6) = 0\n\nAdding four squares together, we get:\n\n(1 - y^2/\u221a6 + x^2/\u221a6) = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by 6, we get:\n\n6 * (1 - y^2/\u221a6 + x^2/\u221a6) = 0\n\nSince this is an equality, we can divide both sides by 6 to get:\n\n(1 - y^2/\u221a6 + x^2/\u221a6) = 0/6\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n1 - y^2/\u221a6 + x^2/\u221a6 = 0\n\nNow, we want to find the minimum value of this expression.

If the metric space is countable, it is completely metrizable and thus sequentially compact.\n\nAn metric space is **complete** if for any Cauchy sequence in the space, the sequence converges.\n\nNow, respective properties:\n(A) follows from the compactness theorem, which states that any complete metric space that is also sequentially compact is metrizable. So compactness implies completeness in this case.\n(B) follows from the fact that a complete metric space must also be sequentially compact. If a metric space is complete, then any Cauchy sequence converges, and any sequence has a convergent subsequence. Therefore, complete metric spaces are automatically sequentially compact.\n(C) If (A) is false, then there exists a complete metric space that is not sequentially compact (use the connectedness of $(0,1)$). And if (B) is false, then there exists a sequentially compact metric space that is not complete (use $\\prod_{n=1}^{{\\bullet}} Q$ where $(Q,d)$ is Hausdorff and complete).\n(D) This case couldn't happen as (A) and (B) couldn't both be true.",
