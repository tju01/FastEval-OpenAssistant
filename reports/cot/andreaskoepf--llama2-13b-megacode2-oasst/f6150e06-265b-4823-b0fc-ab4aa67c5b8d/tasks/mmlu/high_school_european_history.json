One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others.

However, nowhere in the quote does he specifically express his religious beliefs or lack thereof.\n\nOption C claims that most Enlightenment intellectuals rejected religion and adopted atheism, but the given quote does not mention Voltaire's stance on atheism. Therefore, option C is not supported by the information provided in the quote.\n\nOption A suggests that many Enlightenment intellectuals were accomplished scientists and made significant contributions to human understanding of the universe.

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following memoir.\nNot only did he expect all persons of distinction to be in continual attendance at Court, but he was quick to notice the absence of those of inferior degree; at his lever, his couches, his meals, in the gardens of Versailles (the only place where the courtiers in general were allowed to follow him), he used to cast his eyes to right and left; nothing escaped him[;] he saw everybody. If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?\n\n(A) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.\n(B) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.\n(C) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.\n(D) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported King Louis's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, while he removed their power.",

The text describes how the king would notice the absence of courtiers and hold those absent in displeasure. Although very clear, this is not the main clue.\n2. The text mentions how the king would enchant people with his manner of bestowing favors. This includes praising his courtiers when they spent money lavishly. Again, this is not the main clue.\n2. The duke praises the king's Bestowing manner of favor not only on those attending the court frequently, but also on those who seldom appeared there. If one can read between the lines and understand the duke's context, this blessing is the king's main way to control and reward his courtiers: Free spending on lavish activities, which increases their debt.\n3. The king encouraged these lavish habits to make his courtiers dependent on him. The duke does not criticize the king for this behavior\n\nThe duke gives no hint of any negativity towards King Louis at all. All described behaviors and the next positive statements are presented from the king's point of view, and do not contain any negativity.\nB) The duke doesn't criticize the king's suppression of the nobility, making this statement invalid.\nC) There is no mention of the duke's stance on the expansion of the central state.\nD) The duke describes the king's work as removing inherited power of the nobility while preserving their social standing and legal privileges. \n\nFor the duke to describe the king's work as positive indicates that he views the king in a positive light.

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\n\n(A) De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\n(B) Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\n(C) Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\n(D) De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.",

This is a possibility, as he describes the exchanges between Spaniards and natives in a way that presents his own actions positively and frames the interactions as beneficial to the natives, even though his motives may have been self-serving.\n\nOption (C) proposes that Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions. This option is not directly supported by the information given. While Columbus describes some interactions between Spaniards and natives as beneficial for the natives, he still presents his own actions as justifiable and fair, even if they may not have been viewed that way through the lens of modern sensibilities.\n\nOption (D) suggests that de las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas. This could partially explain the differences between the accounts, as de las Casas's writings provide a much darker and more critical perspective on the treatment of native populations by Spaniards. It is likely that he was deeply concerned about the destruction and exploitation of indigenous peoples and wanted to shine a light on the atrocities being committed.\n\nOverall, the information provided suggests that the differences between the accounts of Columbus and de las Casas may stem from their different motivations, perspectives, and experiences.
