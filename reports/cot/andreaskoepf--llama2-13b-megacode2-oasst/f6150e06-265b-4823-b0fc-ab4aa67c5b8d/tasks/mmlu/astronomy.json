            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, let's break it down and analyze each option:\n\n(A) Apparent brightness is related to distance from the observer. But we do not have any information about the object's velocity/speed, so we cannot estimate the speed relative to you.\n\n(B) Composition isn't directly related to apparent brightness. We would require more specific information about the object to estimate its composition.\n\n(C) Appearance could partially refer to size in some cases (e.g., the apparent size of a star/planet would depend on its distance from Earth). Still, size is not the only factor affecting apparent brightness, and we don't have enough information to estimate size accurately.\n\n(D) Apparent brightness is directly proportional to the inverse square of the distance from the observer (inverse square law). If you know the actual brightness of an object and its apparent brightness from your location, then you can use this information to estimate the distance from you.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Distance from you",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(C) The sky appears blue because the Earth's atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths of light, such as blue light, in all directions. This process is called Rayleigh scattering. Longer wavelengths of light, like red and orange, are scattered less and can travel straight through the atmosphere. Therefore, the sky appears blue to us on Earth.",

            "model_answer": "I will go through the options one by one.\n\n(A) While dropping a bowling ball and observing it fall to the ground might provide some evidence for the existence of an attractive force between objects, it is not sufficient to establish the theory as a proven scientific fact. A single experiment is not enough to establish a general theory that applies to all objects.\n\n(B) Repeating an experiment many times is an important step in the scientific method. Replicating results and obtaining consistent results increases the confidence in the theory. However, just repeating the experiment many times is not enough to prove the theory to be correct.\n\n(C) Scientific theories are not proven correct, but rather they are \"yet to be proven wrong\". It means that the current evidence supports the theory and there is no evidence contradicting the theory, so it is considered to be the best currently accepted explanation. However, this does not mean it is proven correct, as new evidence could always emerge that contradicts the theory.\n\n(D) Obtaining widespread agreement among scientists or conducting many experiments is important for establishing a scientific theory. However, it is not sufficient to prove the theory to be correct. A theory must be supported by evidence and be able to accurately explain and predict phenomena.\n\nBased on the analysis of each option, the answer is:\n(C) You can never prove your theory to be correct only \u201cyet to be proven wrong\u201d.",

            "correct_answer": 3,

From the listed options, only statement (C) is true.\n\nTitan is indeed the only moon to have a thick atmosphere, and that atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen. However, Titan does not have a thick hydrocarbon atmosphere; its thick atmosphere is composed mostly of nitrogen, with trace amounts of methane and other compounds. While Titan does have a significant amount of hydrocarbons (mostly methane) in its atmosphere, the hydrocarbons only make up a small fraction of the atmosphere, as opposed to a majority as stated in the question.\n\nStatement (B) is also inaccurate. While Titan has shown signs of recent geological activity, it is not the only outer solar system moon with evidence of geologic activity. Other moons, such as Io, Europa, and Ganymede, have evidence of glacial movements, tectonic activity, and cryovolcanism.",

So, the total energy released (E) in the impact would be equal to the kinetic energy of the comet (KE).\n3. KE is given by:\nKE = 0.5 * m * v^2\n\n4. As the comet impacts the Earth, we need to convert m (mass of comet) to kg. This will give us the kinetic energy in Joules.\n5. Since the mass of the Earth (M) and its radius (R) are constant, we can use them in our expression for E.\n6. Now, substitute KE from step 3 and m in the form of kg from step 4 into the expression for E.\n\nAnswer: (A) m*v",
