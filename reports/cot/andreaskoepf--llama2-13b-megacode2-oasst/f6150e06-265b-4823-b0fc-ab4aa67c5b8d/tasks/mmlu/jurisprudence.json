            "model_answer": "The purpose of Hart's distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation' is:\n(A) It demonstrates the difference between the internal and the external aspect of a rule.\n\nIn his book \"The Concept of Law,\" Hart distinguishes between two different senses in which one can be under an obligation: being obliged and having an obligation. Being obliged refers to the psychological state of being under a sense of duty or necessity to follow a rule. Having an obligation, on the other hand, refers to the existence of a rule that requires someone to act in a certain way. This distinction is important because it allows Hart to draw a distinction between internal and external aspects of a rule.\n\n Being obliged refers to the internal aspect of a rule, which is the individual's subjective sense of duty or necessity to follow the rule. On the other hand, having an obligation refers to the external aspect of a rule, which is the existence of a normative requirement that binds individuals to follow the rule.\n\nThis distinction is significant because it allows Hart to argue that a rule can exist without there being any individuals who are obliged to follow it. For example, a law can exist that requires drivers to wear seatbelts, but there may be no individuals who feel a sense of duty or necessity to wear seatbelts. Moreover, this distinction also allows Hart to argue that being obliged to follow a rule is not necessarily a sufficient condition for having an obligation to follow a rule. For example, someone may feel a sense of duty to follow a rule, but if the rule does not actually require anyone to follow it, then they do not have an obligation to follow the rule.\n\nHart's distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation' is important because it allows him to draw a distinction between internal and external aspects of a rule. This distinction is significant for understanding the nature of law and the relationship between law and individual morality.",

            "question": "Maine's famous aphorism that 'the movement of progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from Status to Contract' is often misunderstood.

            "model_answer": "In order to answer this question, let's go through the options step by step:\n\n(A) It is misinterpreted as a prediction.\nThis could be a possible way that Maine's aphorism is misunderstood. When something is referred to as a movement, it could be interpreted as a prediction of future motion. So it could be read that Maine predicted the motion of progressive societies to move from status to contract, which could be misunderstood as Maine being a prophet predicting the future.\n\n(B) His concept of status is misrepresented.\nThis also could be a possible way that Maine's aphorism is misunderstood. The concept of status is an important one in Maine's work, however if someone misrepresents it, it could lead to misunderstanding of the aphorism.\n\n(C) It is taken literally.\nThis option seems like a less possible way that Maine's aphorism is misunderstood. Although taken literally could lead to some confusion, the aphorism is quite complex and therefore it is less likely that it would be taken literally.\n\n(D) His idea is considered inapplicable to Western legal systems.\nThis option also suggests that Maine's aphorism could be misunderstood, however with the context of the other options it seems considerably less plausible. If someone did consider all of Maine's ideas to be inapplicable to Western legal systems it could lead to misunderstanding of the aphorism, however it suggests that the entirety of his philosophy is being misjudged, which is less probable than other interpretations.\n\nAfter considering all the options it seems that option (A) 'It is misinterpreted as a prediction' is the most plausible way Maine's aphorism is misunderstood.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, first we need to understand what Llewellyn's distinction between the grand and formal styles of legal reasoning is, and the criticisms given.\n\nLlewellyn's distinction refers to the way that judges reason through cases. The grand style is characterized by creative, attractive, and influential reasoning, while the formal style is characterized by a strict adherence to legal precedent and doctrine. Llewellyn believed that judges often used the grand style to bestow moral approval on their decisions, while using the formal style to cloak their decisions in neutral legal language.\n\nNow let's look at the criticisms:\n\n(A) There is no distinction between the two forms of legal reasoning.\nThis criticism suggests that there is no meaningful difference between the two styles of reasoning, and that there is not enough evidence to support Llewellyn's distinctions.\n\n(B) Judges are appointed to interpret the law, not to make it.\nThis criticism suggests that judges should adhere strictly to legal precedent and doctrine, rather than imposing their own moral pronouncements on the law.\n\n(C) It is misleading to pigeon-hole judges in this way.\nThis criticism suggests that it is inaccurate to characterize judges as using one style of reasoning over another, and that the distinction oversimplifies the complexities of legal reasoning.\n\n(D) Judicial reasoning is always formal.\nThis criticism suggests that all legal reasoning is governed by strict doctrinal rules, and that there is no room for creativity or other forms of grand reasoning in the law.\n\nBased on this information, the most compelling criticism of Llewellyn's distinction is (A): There is no distinction between the two forms of legal reasoning. This is because Llewellyn's distinction is based on a limited amount of empirical evidence, and there are several potential interpretations of judicial behavior that could account for the observed phenomena. Additionally, the distinction has been criticized for oversimplifying complex legal issues and promoting a certain view of the role of judges in the legal system.",

            "model_answer": "(B) The POP will choose equality over power.\n\nAccording to John Rawls, the Priority of the PRIMARY GOODS (POP) principle states that a just society should prioritize the provision of basic social rights and opportunities over individual growth and self-fulfillment. This means that the POP would likely choose to prioritize equality over power or other individual concerns. While the POP would also likely prioritize the well-being of individuals with disabilities and be compassionate towards those in need, the most consistent choice in respect of 'social primary goods' as per Rawls' theory would be option (B).",

Weber pointed out that the common law system in England operated on the principle of precedent and allowed judges to create new law and interpret statutes. This system allowed for more certainty and predictability in business transactions and commercial law.\n\nWeber argued that this ability for judges to create new law allowed for a type of legitimate domination that facilitated the development of capitalism. This legitimate domination created a stable and predictable economic environment that allowed businesses to grow and flourish.\n\nTherefore, Weber's solution to England's 'Problem' was to explain the difference between the common law and civil law systems and the role that legitimate domination played in the development of capitalism.",
