            "model_answer": "The current scientific consensus is that there are two known human polyomaviruses.\n\n**Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus** (KSHV), also known as **Human Herpesvirus 8** (HHV-8), was discovered in 1994. It is a cancer-causing virus that is primarily associated with Kaposi's sarcoma, a type of cancer that commonly affects people with compromised immune systems, such as those infected with HIV/AIDS. KSHV is also associated with other cancers, including primary effusion lymphoma, and may play a role in the development of certain forms of leukemia.\n\n**BK Virus** (BKV), also known as **Human Polyomavirus 1** (HPyV1), was discovered in 1971. BKV is a common virus that typically does not cause symptoms in healthy individuals but can lead to serious complications in immunocompromised individuals, such as organ transplant recipients. BKV infection in transplant recipients can result in BK virus-associated nephropathy, a type of kidney disease that can be life-threatening if left untreated.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) All of the above.\n\nAIDS activism in the U.S. has significantly impacted society and the way medicine is practiced. In the 1980s, as the AIDS epidemic began to unfold, AIDS activists began to advocate for changes in the ways that medicine and government were handling the crisis.\n\nOne of the most important results of AIDS activism was changes in the way the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated drugs. Activists pushed for faster approval of new drugs and more flexible trials, leading to the creation of the FDA's \"Accelerated Approval\" process. This process allowed drugs to be approved based on surrogate markers of efficacy, rather than direct evidence of improved patient outcomes.\n\nAnother significant outcome of AIDS activism was easier access to investigational drugs. Activists pressured pharmaceutical companies to make experimental drugs available to patients, and also lobbied the FDA to allow expanded access to such drugs. This led to the creation of the FDA's \"Compassionate Use\" program, which allows patients with life-threatening illnesses to access investigational drugs outside of clinical trials.\n\nFinally, AIDS activism also resulted in changes in the way medicine was practiced in the U.S. Activists pushed for a more patient-centered approach to care, challenging traditional medical hierarchies and practices. They also advocated for more research into HIV/AIDS and for better access to prevention and treatment services for marginalized communities. These changes have had lasting impacts on the way medicine is practiced in the U.S., making it more responsive to the needs of patients and communities.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The incubation period is typically the time frame that occurs between being exposed to a virus and showing symptoms of the infection.\nDuring this time, the virus is replicating within the body and spreading to various cells, although the person infected may not yet show any signs of being sick.\n\nHere is the reasoning for each option:\n(A) The virus is cleared from the body by the immune system: This is not what happens during the incubation period. The immune system does not clear the virus until much later, typically after symptoms have started to show.\n(B) Virus replication happens at an intracellular level: This is one of the aspects of what goes on during the incubation period. But replication is not the only thing happening during this time.\n(C) This period commonly lasts for a few days: This is correct! The incubation period for many viruses typically lasts for a few days before the person shows symptoms of being sick. However, the length of the incubation period can vary from virus to virus and from person to person, and can range from a few hours to many days.\n(D) This period commonly lasts for a few hours: This is incorrect. While some viruses can have very short incubation periods of just a few hours, most viruses have incubation periods that last much longer than this, typically ranging from several days to a few weeks.\n\nTherefore, the final line should contain the answer as a single letter with parenthesis: (C)",

They are the most risk-averse, and they tend to wait until a new idea or product has been proven before they adopt it.\n\nSo, if you want to achieve effective change in a community, you need to focus on getting the innovators and early adopters on board.

However, while antibodies are an important component of the adaptive immune system, they are not its most special characteristic.\n\n(B) T cells: T cells also play a significant role in the adaptive immune system. They are responsible for recognizing and destroying infected cells and for activating other immune cells. However, like antibodies, T cells are not the most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system.\n\n(C) Memory T cells: Memory T cells are a specialized type of T cell that can remember specific pathogens and mount a rapid response upon subsequent encounter with the same pathogen. They are crucial for long-term immunity, but they represent only a subset of T cells.\n\n(D) Clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells: This option refers to the unique ability of the adaptive immune system to expand a small number of specific cells (clones) in response to an infection or allergen. This clonal expansion allows for a highly targeted and specific immune response.

            "model_answer": "Chemotherapy is a general term for treatment of cancer and other disease with drugs. It can be divided into four categories:\n\n1. Mitotic poisons: These drugs interfere with cell division (mitosis) by targeting DNA replication or other aspects of cell division. Mitotic poisons are grouped into two different families:\n\n   * Alkylating agents: They interfere with DNA synthesis by alkylating guanine or other nitrogenous bases in the DNA molecule, disrupting DNA structures and interfering with DNA synthesis and repair.\n\n   * Antimetabolites: They interfere with the synthesis or incorporation of nucleic acids, often replacing normal molecules and disrupting DNA replication or synthesis.\n\n2. Monoclonal antibodies: These drugs are designed to specifically bind to certain receptors or molecules on cancer cells and trigger immune-mediated destruction of the cells.\n\n3. Antimicrobial agents: These drugs are used to treat infections in cancer patients and to prevent or treat infections caused by cancer treatments.\n\n4. Hormones: These drugs are used to treat hormone-responsive cancer, such as breast or prostate cancer, by interfering with hormone production or action.\n\nGiven the options given:\n\n- Interferon and ribavirin are not used as chemotherapy agents, but as immunomodulatory drugs, mainly in the treatment of Hepatitis C.
