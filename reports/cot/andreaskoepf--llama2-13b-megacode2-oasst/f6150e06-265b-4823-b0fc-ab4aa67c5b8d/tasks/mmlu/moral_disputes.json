The just war theory consists of two parts: jus ad bellum, which deals with the justification of going to war, and jus in bello, which deals with the conduct of war. The principle of military necessity is related to the conduct of war and therefore belongs to jus in bello.",

He argued that there is a prima facie duty of honesty, which means that there is a general obligation to tell the truth in all cases. Therefore, if certain speech is likely to be true, it should not be censored, even if it might cause harm.",

Let's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) Allowing a patient to harm themself: This option suggests that offering euthanasia could lead to patients taking their own lives prematurely or without proper consideration of alternative options. It implies a concern for patient safety and well-being.\n\n(B) Forcing doctors to harm the patient: This option raises a concern about the moral duty of doctors not to harm their patients. By offering euthanasia, doctors may feel pressured into providing a service that goes against their conscience or ethical beliefs.\n\n(C) Harming the patient's family: This option suggests that offering euthanasia could cause emotional distress for the family members of the patient. It raises concerns about the impact of the decision on loved ones and the potential for family turmoil.\n\n(D) Harming the patient: This option directly addresses the potential harm to the patient themselves. The argument here is that euthanasia goes against the basic principle of medical care, which is to save and preserve life. Ending a patient's life could be seen as violating a fundamental moral and ethical principle.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, let's determine which one is the most fitting answer to the question:\n\nVelleman worries that, by offering a patient the option of euthanasia, (D) we harm the patient.\n\nIs there anything else you would like me to explain or help with?
