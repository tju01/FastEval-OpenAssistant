According to the key, (\u2200y)(Ay \u2283 Bxy) means that \"For every y, if x is an apartment (Ax) then x is bigger than y (Bxy)\". The given proposition states that some houses are smaller than all apartments. This can be expressed as (\u2203x)(Hx \u2227 \u2200y)(Ay \u2227 \u00acBxy), which means that there exists some house (Hx) that is not bigger than any apartment (\u2200y)(Ay \u2227 \u00acBxy).\n\nHowever, this does not match the translation key, as it doesn't include the \"large\" condition (L).
