However, the United States continued to push westward towards Oregon, settling and claiming land that was still within the claimed territory of Great Britain. This led to tensions and eventually the Oregon Treaty of 1846, which established the boundary at the 49th parallel. U.S. settlers had arrived in the region before British settlers or any formal claims by Great Britain, and therefore had already claimed the land for the United States.",

It's not directly related to immigration or national origin.\n(B) The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 - These acts were a series of laws passed by the U.S. Congress in 1798 that aimed to restrict immigration and silence political dissent. They reflect a nativist attitude towards foreigners and immigrants.\n(C) The Espionage Act of 1917 - This act was enacted to prevent interference with the U.S. military during World War I, and it was not directly related to immigration or national origin.\n(D) The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 - This act aimed to eliminate national-origin quotas in immigration policies and increase the number of immigrants allowed into the U.S. It reflects a more inclusive attitude towards immigration than nativism.\n\n3.
