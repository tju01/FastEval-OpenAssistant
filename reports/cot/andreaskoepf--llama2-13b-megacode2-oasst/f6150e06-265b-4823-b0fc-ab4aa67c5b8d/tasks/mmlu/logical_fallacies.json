A disjunctive syllogism includes two disjuncts that do not necessarily contradict each other, and the conclusion can be either affirmed or denied.\n(B) classifies subjects - This is not correct. A disjunctive syllogism does not use a classification of subjects to reach a conclusion.\n(C) affirms the antecedent or denies the consequent - This is not correct. A disjunctive syllogism does not have an antecedent and a consequent.\n(D) leads to a valid conclusion - This is correct.

This typically involves criticizing or discrediting the source, making it less likely for someone to accept the argument or evidence from that source. This fallacy does not necessarily have to do with the relationship between a flaw and the reliability of a source, but rather focuses on undermining the source's credibility altogether.\n\nHere are more details about the fallacies:\n\n(A) Significance; This fallacy does not seem to fit the description.\n(B) Snob appeal is more concerned with the perceived social status of the source, rather than the actual reliability of the source.\n(C) Poisoning the well involves attacking the source's credibility or character, without necessarily connecting it to the content of the source.\n(D) An appeal to anonymous authority is when someone uses the authority of an unnamed expert to support an argument, without providing any evidence of their qualifications or the relevance of their opinion.",

It involves treating the argument so dismissively that it is as if the person doing the ridiculing simply cannot believe anyone would seriously present such an argument in the first place. This dismissal of the argument is what the \"horse laugh\" in the fallacy's name comes from.\n\nLet's take a look at each of the given options:\n\n(A) responding to an argument with an expression of derision instead of a counter argument\n(B) attempts to gain agreement based solely the feelings aroused by the message\n(C) characterizing an opponent's position in such way to make it or its consequences appear to be ridiculous\n(D) arguing actions should be taken to avoid negative results, when those results are exaggerated, unlikely, or irrelevant\n\nBased on the definition of the horse laugh fallacy and how it relates to dismissing an argument without offering a counter argument, we can see that option (A) closely matches the characteristics of the fallacy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n(A) responding to an argument with an expression of derision instead of a counter argument.",
