            "question": "The middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century were:\n\n(A) an urban set, involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations\n(B) too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness\n(C) often involved in 'white collar' work\n(D) all of the above",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "I will explain my thought process step by step. Let's evaluate each option for the middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century:\n\n(A) an urban set, involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations\nIn the 19th century, many cities expanded rapidly, and the development of railways and the rise in middle-class professions such as clerks, teachers, and administrators tended to locate them in urban centres. Civic bodies (such as town councils) and voluntary associations (charities, educational establishments, etc.) provided middle-class people opportunities to collaborate and display their social values. Hence, this option is plausible.\n\n(B) too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness\nIn the 19th century, the middle classes included both modern professionals and craftsmen, leading merchants and small tradesmen, agricultural landowners, and white-collar workers. Some members of those groups might have shared a sense of identity as people with a certain type of occupation. But others likely differed in their social status, education, beliefs and values. Thus, it is plausible that the middle classes were diverse enough to mitigate a strong sense of class consciousness. This option is also plausible.\n\n(C) often involved in 'white collar' work\nIn the 19th century, 'white collar' became popular (though not yet standard) to denote middle-class occupations, including office clerks, managers, professionals (lawyers, doctors, etc.). As said before, it is possible that their urban location and involvement in voluntary associations increased their contact and cooperation with each other. This option is plausible.\n\n(D) all of the above\nAll three previous statements are plausible. So, the combination of all of them being correct is possible too.\n\nAfter evaluating the options, it seems the most accurate option is (D) all of the above, because all the three previous statements are plausible.\n\nAnswer: D",

            "model_answer": "Technological forms of surveillance have made it easier to:\n\n(A) access and exchange 'private' information about consumers. This is because technological surveillance allows for the collection and analysis of large amounts of data, which can be used for targeted advertising and other consumer-related activities.\n(C) monitor employees' activities at work. This is because surveillance technology such as cameras and monitoring software can be used to keep track of employee behavior and productivity.\n\nHowever, electronic tagging is not a form of surveillance, but rather a form of electronic monitoring that is used to track the whereabouts of individuals, usually in criminal justice or immigration contexts. Therefore, the answer is not (D) all of the above.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "I will try to explain step-by-step.\n\nGemeinschaft refers to a type of social relationship characterized by close personal ties, shared values, and a sense of belonging. According to Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies, gemeinschaft is typically found in small, tightly-knit communities where individuals have a strong sense of identity and loyalty to the group. On the other hand, gesellschaft refers to a type of social relationship characterized by impersonal relationships, individualism, and a sense of detachment from the group.\n\nNow let's look at the given options:\n\n(A) Organic solidarity: This term is related to the French sociologist \u00c9mile Durkheim's concept of social solidarity. He argued that society is held together by shared values, beliefs, and norms that create a sense of cohesion and unity. This is similar to the concept of gemeinschaft in that it emphasizes the importance of interpersonal relationships and shared values in uniting a society.\n\n(B) Mechanical solidarity: This term is also related to Durkheim's work and refers to a type of social relationship characterized by strong traditional bonds and a shared collective consciousness. This type of solidarity is found in small, static societies where people depend on one another for survival. This is similar to the concept of gemeinschaft in that it emphasizes the importance of shared values, traditions, and interpersonal relationships in holding society together.\n\n(C) Gesellschaft: This is the German word for society and is used by T\u00f6nnies to describe the opposite of gemeinschaft. Gesellschaft is characterized by impersonal relationships, individualism, and a sense of detachment from the group. This is the opposite of gemeinschaft in that it emphasizes the importance of individualism, rationality, and objective relationships in forging social bonds.\n\n(D) Anomie: Anomie, also known as normlessness, is a societal condition characterized by a lack of social norms, values, and a sense of belonging. This is typically associated with industrialization and urbanization, which lead to a breakdown of traditional community ties and a loss of shared values. Anomie is the opposite of gemeinschaft in that it emphasizes the disintegration of social bonds and the loss of a collective sense of identity.\n\nNow we know that gemeinschaft and gesellschaft are opposites. Therefore:\n\nThe concept of gemeinschaft developed by Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies describes basically the same relational characteristics as (A) organic solidarity and (B) mechanical solidarity",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B).\n\nThere was a growth in income inequality in the 1980s because there were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them. As a result, the demand for skilled workers increased, leading to higher wages for these workers. At the same time, there was a decline in the number of low-skilled jobs, which led to stagnant or decreasing wages for these workers. This widened the income gap between the rich and the poor.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to define what \"normalized\" means in the context of deviant acts. Normally phenomenon typically arises in systems which exhibit natural laws. Behavioral norms also typically have natural laws governing their establishments and evolutions. It's evident that norm establishment and evolution is not simply a matter of opinion or belief alone, thus deviant norms which arise through processes like consensus, belief, or manipulation are likely to have underlying factors which result in them behaving like natural laws. It's common for deviant norms to arise and compete with naturally established norms. When deviant norms are viewed and treated as natural, something analogous to natural law, they are said to be \"normalized\".\n\nGiven this definition, we can now look at the options:\n\n(A) recognised as breaking an important norm of behaviour - This contradicts what \"normalized\" means, which is for the deviant norm to be perceived as natural, not as breaking other norms.\n\n(B) seen a temporary aberration from an otherwise 'normal' character - This seems like it could be related because something being a temporary aberration can be seen as part of nature, just like how a cloud can be seen as a temporary aberration in an otherwise clear sky.\n\n(C) the first step in establishing a deviant career - This doesn't seem correct for two reasons. First because it's referring to the deviant act as something you can have a career in, which doesn't necessarily align with it being regarded as natural. Second, the process of establishing a norm like a career doesn't necessarily result in the norm being normalized.\n\n(D) attributed to the person's genetic or anatomical make up - While this doesn't fully capture the essence of normalization via natural laws, it is the closest of all the options to the concept - because deviant acts which arise due to inherent person qualities can be seen as part of nature when they become norms.\n\nGiven our analysis, we can tentatively say that the answer is: \n\nD",

Traditionally, the owner of a company was also the manager, making decisions about the business based on their own interests. John Scott, in his 1997 argument, suggested that this was changing.

Marxism emphasizes the exploitation of the working class by the ruling class for economic gain, and Marxist feminism extends that analysis to include the exploitation of women by men through the sex class system.",
