Hence, this statement is false.\n\n(D) The Supreme Court has established the principle of \"categorical exclusion\" of religious speech from public schools, which means that religious activity cannot be sponsored by the state. However, students' religious speech and expression are protected under the First Amendment, as long as it does not disrupt the educational function of the school.

Both GED holders and high school dropouts have similar voter turnout rates.\n\n(C) Registered voters are more likely to vote in general elections than they are in primary elections.\nThis statement is likely true given that primary elections often have lower voter turnout due to their timing and the fact that they are typically only accessible to registered party members.\n\n(D) More women than men have voted in every presidential election since 1980.\nThis statement is false.

However, the vice president does not directly manage the cabinet.\n\n(B) President's Chief of Staff: The president's chief of staff is responsible for managing the president's schedule, overseeing communications with the White House staff and cabinet secretaries, and acting as the president's liaison to various groups. This position would likely have significant influence over cabinet secretary access to the president.\n\n(C) National Security Advisor: The national security advisor is responsible for advising the president on national security matters and coordinating the activities of the National Security Council.
