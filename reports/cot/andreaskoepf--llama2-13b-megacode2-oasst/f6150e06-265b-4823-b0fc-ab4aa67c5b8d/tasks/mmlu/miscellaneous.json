Why is this important? Fires start at various temperatures and materials differ in their ignition properties. For instance: \n- A flame will start to ignite linen at 646\u00b0F (341\u00b0C). \n- Cotton will start burning at 418\u00b0F (215\u00b0C). \n- However, wood will already burn at 374\u00b0F (191\u00b0C).",

Therefore, this could be a valid option.\n\n(B) Strawberry: Strawberry is typically a light pink color, and Apple has not released iMacs in this color. It is not a valid option.\n\n(C) Kiwi: Kiwi is a green color, and while Apple has not released iMacs in a pure green color, they have released iMacs in a color similar to Kiwi, which is called \"Jade Green.\" Therefore, this could be a valid option.\n\n(D) Grape: Grape is a dark purple color, and Apple has never released iMacs in this color.

            "question": "A teacher provides support for small, flexible groups of beginning readers. As students read a text or a book that is unfamiliar to them, the teacher works with the students to teach them how to use a variety of reading strategies. Which of the following reading approaches is described?\n\n(A) Direct instruction\n(B) Literature circle\n(C) Guided reading\n(D) Read-aloud",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "This question describes an instructional approach known as Guided Reading. Here's the reasoning:\n\n(A) Direct Instruction: Direct instruction is a teaching approach that emphasizes explicit teaching of skills and rote learning. It's a one-size-fits-all approach, where students receive the same instruction regardless of their level or ability. In guided reading, each group receives instruction customized to their needs.\n(B) Literature Circle: Literature circles are student-centered activities, typically used in the context of a whole-class novel study. Students read independently, then come together in a circle to discuss the text and complete tasks related to it. Guided reading involves teacher-led instruction with small groups.\n(C) Guided Reading: Guided reading is a teacher-led instructional approach used to support struggling readers. As described in the question, students read text or books they are unfamiliar with, while the teacher teaches them reading strategies. Groups are small and flexible, with instruction personalized to meet the students' needs.\n(D) Read-aloud: Read-aloud is an activity where the teacher reads aloud to the entire class. Students listen and follow along, typically either in their own books or on a projector. It's a whole-class activity that doesn't involve small-group instruction personalized to individual students' needs.\n\nTherefore, the approach described in the question is **(C) Guided Reading**",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Germanium is a relatively non-linear semiconductor, which means that its electrical resistance can vary a great deal with even small changes in temperature. Therefore, it is the material that is most affected by temperature changes.\nOut of the given alternatives Carbon and Silicon are both elements, which means they belong to the metals that generally have a coefficient of thermal expansion that is more thermally stable than that of germanium. Therefore, they are less affected by temperature changes.\nLastly Copper is a popular metallic wire used in electrical grids because of its high conductivity and because it has such a low thermal coefficient of resistance. Since the thermal coefficient of resistance is an indirect measure of how much a material will change its resistance with a change in temperature, it is the material that is least affected by temperature changes",
