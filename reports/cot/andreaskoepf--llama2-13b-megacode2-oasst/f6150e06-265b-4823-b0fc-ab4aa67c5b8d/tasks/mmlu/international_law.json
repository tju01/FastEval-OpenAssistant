This is except in certain circumstances such as piracy or when a state requests the assistance of another in certain maritime law matters. This jurisdiction is established by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).",

Justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular right conforms to principles of justice.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Humanitarian intervention refers to the use of force by one state without the consent of another in order to prevent or stop large-scale human suffering (often due to internal strife such as war, ethnic conflict or mass atrocity). On the other hand, Responsibility to Protect (R2P) is a norm which provides that states have the responsibility to prevent and protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. \n\nR2P provides a framework that emphasizes a \"priority of prevention\" and encourages non-coercive measures, including diplomatic efforts and capacity building, to address potential crises. In contrast, humanitarian intervention focuses primarily on humanitarian objectives and may involve the use of force to protect civilians. R2P also requires a case-by-case assessment of the scale, nature, and likelihood of a threat to civilian life, as well as an attempt to use peaceful means to prevent harm, such as diplomatic and economic measures.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis",

Let's break down the provided options to understand this obligation.\n\n(A) It is an obligation of result: This option suggests that States have a strict obligation to resolve their disputes as soon as possible, regardless of the means they use. However, this does not necessarily imply that they must use peaceful means to resolve these disputes.\n\n(B) It is an obligation of conduct: This option suggests that States have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means. It does not mean that they must always resolve their disputes peacefully, but they must make a genuine effort to do so.\n\n(C) It is a peremptory norm of international law: This option states that the peaceful settlement of disputes is a fundamental principle of international law that all States have a legal obligation to follow. It does not necessarily mean that they must always resolve their disputes peacefully, but they must make a genuine effort to do so.\n\n(D) It is an obligation which concerns solely international courts and tribunals: This option suggests that the peaceful settlement of disputes only applies to cases brought before international courts and tribunals. However, this is not true since the obligation also applies to disputes between States that are resolved through other means, such as diplomatic negotiations or mediation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most accurate option is (B) It is an obligation of conduct. States have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means, but they are not strictly obligated to always resolve their disputes peacefully.",

This option is the closest to the definition of a \"rock\" under UNCLOS as per article 121 (3) which states that \"Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own, and accordingly have no Exclusive Economic Zone or continental shelf, are not islands.\" So, this is a potential correct answer.\n\n(D) This option refers to small islands that can sustain human habitation.

International legal personality asserts that an entity has the recognition of rights and duties under international law and the capacity to enforce these rights through appropriate legal means. \n\n(C) This statement is incorrect because it suggests that the entity has authority over states, which is not the case. Rather, international legal personality allows entities to interact legally with states and other subjects of international law in ways that align with the rights and duties afforded to them under international law, but it does not afford the entity authority over states. \n\n(D) This statement seems to describe a characteristic of an entity that is assigned a form of international legal personality, rather than actually defining the concept.

Some UN special mandates, such as the Special Rapporteur on the right to education, are treaty-based and established by a specific treaty (e.g., the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights).
