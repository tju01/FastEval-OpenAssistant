            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "1. Calculate the total number of hours rented in a year if you work all year round, including weekends. There are 365 days in a year, so the total number of hours rented per year will be 365 * 2 = 730 hours.\n2. Calculate the gross revenue generated from renting the limousine. The rental rate is $245 per hour, so the gross revenue will be 730 * $245 = $176,950.\n3. Calculate the total daily costs, including both fixed costs and variable costs. The fixed costs include the cost of buying the limousine, which is $98,000. The variable costs include the daily running cost of $50. So, the total daily costs will be $98,000 + $50 = $98,050.\n4. Calculate the operating profit generated from renting the limousine. The operating profit can be calculated as the gross revenue minus the total daily costs, i.e., $176,950 - $98,050 = $78,900.\n5. Calculate the net profit generated from renting the limousine. The net profit can be calculated as the operating profit minus the fixed costs, i.e., $78,900 - $98,000 = -$19,100.\n\nSo, the estimated yearly yield on your investment is -19.1%, which is not listed in the given options. Did you mean to ask for the estimated yearly yield on your investment as a percentage of the limousine's total cost? If so, you can calculate it as follows:\n\n(Operating profit / Total cost) * 100\n\n(Operating profit / Total cost) = ($78,900 / $98,000) = 0.7995 or approximately 0.80.\n\nThus, the estimated yearly yield on your investment as a percentage of the limousine's total cost is approximately 0.80 or 80%. However, this is not listed in the given options either. Are these the correct given options or their transcription errors? Or would you like me to calculate some other financial metrics related to your investment? Let me know, and I'll be happy to help.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first analyze the correct amortization methods for the bond premium:\n\n1. Straight-line method: This method amortizes the bond premium over the life of the bond using a constant periodic rate. In this case, Dean Co. used the straight-line method.\n\n2. Effective interest method: This method amortizes the bond premium over the life of the bond using the effective interest rate, which takes into account the coupon rate, any discount or premium, and the time to maturity.\n\nSince Dean Co. incorrectly used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method to amortize the premium, the amortization of the bond premium would be different than what would be expected under the effective interest method.\n\nNow, let's see how this error would affect the amounts mentioned in the question at June 30 year 12:\n\n1. Bond carrying amount: The carrying amount of the bond would be affected by the error in amortization, as the amortization of the premium would be different than what would be expected under the effective interest method. As a result, the bond carrying amount would be either overstated or understated.\n\n2. Retained earnings: The retained earnings would be affected by the error in amortization because the incorrect amortization of the premium would impact the reported accrued interest and any expenses associated with the bond premium. As a result, the retained earnings would be either overstated or understated.\n\n3. Bond premium: The bond premium itself would not be affected by the error in amortization, as the premium itself is a separate component of the bond. However, the amortization of the premium over time would be different than what would be expected under the effective interest method, which would impact the carrying amount and retained earnings.\n\nConsidering the information above, we can now determine the answer:\n\n(B) Understated Overstated",

Let's check if there are any mistakes in the numbers:\n\n3 years is indeed 3 coupons per year.\nThe face value is indeed $100.\nThe coupon is indeed 5%.\nThe yield is indeed 6%.\n\nLet's try checking if the bond math is correct. The bond should pay coupons every 1/4 year (also known as semi-annually). Since half a year times 3 years is only 1.5 years, it should pay 1.5 coupons in total. The coupon rate should be 5%/2 = 2.5%. The effective coupon rate should be 20/4 = 5%/2 = 2.5% as well.\n\nSo the correct formula is:\n\nP = F / (1 + rn)^-n\n\nwhere:\nP = price of the bondF = face value of the bondr = effective coupon rate n = number of coupon payments per year\n\nLet's plug in the correct values and solve for P:\n\nP = $100 / (1 + 2.5%)^-1.5\nP = $100 / (1.025)^-1.5\nP = $100 / 0.8786\nP = $113.64\n\nSo the price of the bond should be $113.64.

Here we go:\n\nStatement A: It will be reclassified as an asset held for sale\nReasoning: When a company decides to sell a fixed asset, it is considered \"held for sale\" and is reclassified as such. This is because the asset is no longer being used in the company's day-to-day operations, and its value is expected to be realized through the sale.\n\nStatement B: It will be classified as a current asset\nReasoning: A current asset is an asset that is expected to be converted to cash within one year (or the company's year-end, if it is different). Since the sale of the old building is expected to be completed in four months, it is considered a current asset.\n\nStatement C: It will no longer be depreciated\nReasoning: Depreciation is a method of allocating the cost of a fixed asset over its useful life. When an asset is sold, the remaining depreciation expense is recognized as income, as the asset has not been fully depreciated. Since the old building is expected to be sold, it will no longer be depreciated.\n\nStatement D: It will be valued at historical cost\nReasoning: When an asset is held for sale, it is usually valued at the lower of its cost or fair value. Fair value is the amount for which the asset could be sold in the current market environment. Historical cost, on the other hand, is the original cost of the asset when it was purchased. Therefore, it is unlikely that the old building will be valued at historical cost if it is held for sale.\n\nSo, the statement that is not correct is:\nD. It will be valued at historical cost",

            "model_answer": "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Carson owns 40% of the outstanding stock of a C corporation. Since Carson is a shareholder of the corporation, he is also a partial owner of the company's profits.\n\n2. The corporation reported $400,000 in taxable income during the tax year. This income must be distributed to the shareholders according to their ownership percentage.\n\n3. The corporation distributed a total of $70,000 in cash dividends to its shareholders, including Carson. This distribution should be proportional to each shareholder's ownership percentage.\n\n4. Carson reported $28,000 in gross income on Carson\u2019s individual tax return. This amount might be derived from the cash dividends he received. However, it is not clear if the cash dividends were Carson's only income from the corporation or if there were other sources of income, such as salary or other distribution forms.\n\n5. If the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions to the owners had been proportionate, the income distribution to the shareholders would have been different. In this case, the distribution would have been determined based on the shareholders' ownership percentages.\n\nLet's assume that if the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions had been proportionate, Carson would have received the same dollar amount in distribution as he did in the C corporation scenario. \n\n6. In the C corporation scenario, the total distribution of $70,000 was distributed proportionally based on the ownership percentage. We know that Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock, so his share of the distribution would have been $70,000 * 40% = $28,000.\n\n7. If the corporation had been an S corporation, Carson would have received the same $28,000 distribution as he did in the C corporation scenario.\n\n8. Since Carson's share of the distribution under the C corporation scenario was $28,000 and under the S corporation scenario would have been the same, his reported income on his individual return would have been the same in both scenarios.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) $28,000.",
