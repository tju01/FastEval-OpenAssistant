            "model_answer": "The Minoan civilization was an ancient Aegean culture on the island of Crete, which flourished in Europe during the Bronze Age (3000-1100 BCE). The Minoans were known for their complex society, advanced technology, and prosperous economy.\n\nAlthough they had trade relations with other ancient civilizations, such as Egypt and the Near East, Minoan culture does not seem to have been driven primarily by commerce. The Minoans had their own distinctive artistic style and were known for their pottery, frescoes, and seals, but there is little evidence that trade played a central role in their culture.\n\nThere is also limited evidence of warfare in Minoan culture. They had a complex social structure with a centralized government, and they are known to have had a navy and fortifications, but there is no record of large-scale military conflict or conquest.\n\nIn terms of religion, Minoan culture had its own distinctive set of deities and rituals, but there is no evidence of a common religion that united the various Minoan societies. The Minoans practiced a mix of naturalistic and anthropomorphic worship, with a particular focus on the goddess(es) of fertility and the bull.\n\nFinally, there is little evidence of conspicuous consumption by the elites in Minoan culture. Unlike other ancient civilizations, such as those of the ancient Near East or Egypt, there is no record of grand palaces, elaborate tombs, or ostentatious displays of wealth by the ruling class. The Minoans did have ritual burials, but these were generally modest in scale and did not involve the same level of extravagance as in other ancient cultures.\n\nGiven this information, the best answer to the question of what Minoan culture shows little evidence of is:\n\n(A) trade.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Sure, let's break this down step-by-step and find the correct answer.\n\n(A) The term \"mobiliary art\" refers to portable art objects, such as jewelry, amulets, and small sculptures that were often carried or moved around. The \"Lion Man\" from Hohlenstein-Stadel cave is not portable, as it is a carving at the entrance of the cave. Therefore, it is not an example of mobiliary art.\n\n(B) The \"Lion Man\" is an example of prehistoric art, but there is no indication that long-distance trade of exotic raw materials was involved in its creation. The stone used in the carving likely came from a nearby source, not as a result of long-distance trade. Therefore, it is not an example of long-distance trade of exotic raw materials.\n\n(C) Parietal art refers to art that is painted or carved on the walls or ceilings of caves. The \"Lion Man\" is a carving found on the ceiling of the Hohlenstein-Stadel cave, so it can be considered an example of parietal art.\n\n(D) A Venus figurine refers to a type of stone figurine depicting a female body, particularly the upper torso and head. The \"Lion Man\" is a carving of a lion-human hybrid and not a woman, so it is not an example of a Venus figurine.\n\nBased on this analysis, the \"Lion Man\" from Hohlenstein-Stadel cave is an example of (C) parietal art.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's go through each option one by one and evaluate if it is present or lacking in the Hopewell society.\n\n(A) formal government: The Hopewell society did not have a centralized government with a monarch or ruling class. Instead, it was a decentralized society with different chiefdoms and social hierarchies.\n\n(B) monumental earthworks: The Hopewell culture is famous for constructing large earthworks such as mounds and enclosures. This is a significant aspect of their culture.\n\n(C) urban centers: The Hopewell culture did not develop large cities or urban centers. Their settlements were scattered and small.\n\n(D) a permanent military: There is little evidence to suggest that the Hopewell society had a standing military or a centralized military organization.\n\nFrom the analysis above, the answer is:\n\n(C) urban centers",

            "question": "The secondarily altricial condition of modern human babies may have been an evolutionary solution, in that:\n\n(A) the brain size of hominids had not grown for more than a million years, making it difficult for babies to walk.\n(B) it allowed for bipedalism and independence from the mother at an earlier age.\n(C) it allowed for subsequent growth of the brain, since bipedalism had resulted in a narrowed birth canal in the female pelvis.\n(D) it allowed for growth of the brain to nearly adult size prior to birth, since bipedalism had resulted in a wider birth canal in the female pelvis.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "There are a few issues with the given answer choices, so let's understand the evolutionary pressures that may have led to modern human babies being born altricial (completely helpless and dependent upon caregivers for survival). We will assess each choice after understanding these evolutionary pressures.\n\nSeveral million years ago, our human ancestors lived in a world where:\n\n- Bipedalism was advantageous for several reasons, such as increased energy efficiency and easier long-distance travel.\n- Predators were common and could pose a significant threat to young and vulnerable infants.\n- Competition for resources, such as food, was fiercer.\n\nThese factors may have created evolutionary pressures for human ancestors to give birth to babies that were:\n\n- Less dependent on caregivers (e.g. parents) for survival, allowing for more independence and autonomy from caretakers.\n\nThis is because, in this environment, an infant that required less care from its parents could grow and develop more quickly and have a higher chance of survival and reproduction.\n\nNow, let's assess each answer choice in light of these evolutionary pressures:\n\n(A) This is not correct. While human brain size has increased over the past few million years, it has not stagnated for more than a million years. Additionally, a larger brain may not have been the sole factor influencing human babies' altricial condition.\n\n(B) This is the most plausible answer from the given options. Altricial offspring of bipedal hominids could grow and develop more rapidly, but require more care, which could make them more dependent than other mammals' more precocial offspring.\n\n(C) While a wider birth canal could have allowed for subsequent brain growth, this would have been unlikely to be a significant factor in human babies' altricial condition, as human brain size had already increased significantly before the emergence of bipedalism.\n\n(D) The opposite is true. Bipedalism likely resulted in a narrower birth canal in the female pelvis, making birth more difficult for human babies.\n\nIn conclusion, a combination of evolutionary pressures, such as bipedalism and predation risk, likely led to the emergence of altricial human babies. Therefore, the most plausible answer is (B).",

            "question": "Research on C3 and C4 pathways indicates that changes in plant communities were associated with a transition in the diets of ancient hominids from:\n\n(A) species focused on grasses to nuts and fruits.\n(B) meat to fruits and vegetables.\n(C) fruits and vegetables to fish.\n(D) nuts and fruits to species more focused on grasses.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we first need to understand the basic aspects of the C3 and C4 pathways in plants. The C3 and C4 pathways are two key photosynthetic processes that plants use to convert carbon dioxide into organic compounds.\n\nThe C3 pathway is the most common pathway for photosynthesis and is found in most plants, including grasses and most dicots (flowering plants with two seed leaves). The C4 pathway allows plants to fix carbon more efficiently and is used by some plants that grow in warm, arid environments, such as grasses.\n\nNow let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) C3 plants are more commonly found in areas where ancient hominids lived, such as grasslands. As grasses represent a significant portion of the diet in these areas, a transition from a diet focused on grasses to one focusing on nuts and fruits would be accompanied by changes in plant communities.\n\n(B) Meat was not a significant part of the diet of ancient hominids, and therefore, a transition from a diet primarily consisting of meat to one primarily consisting of fruits and vegetables would not involve changes in plant communities.\n(C) Most fruits and vegetables are C3 plants, and this option does not make sense in the context of the question.\n(D) A transition in the diet of ancient hominids from nuts and fruits to a diet more focused on grasses would involve changes in plant communities that reflect the abundance of C4 plants, which are more commonly found in grasslands.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) nuts and fruits to species more focused on grasses.",
