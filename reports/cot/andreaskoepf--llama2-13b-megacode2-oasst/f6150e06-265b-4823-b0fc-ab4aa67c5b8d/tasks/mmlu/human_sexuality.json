            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's look at each method and consider whether it involves exposure to radiation:\n\n(A) Needle aspiration: It's a procedure that uses a needle to remove a sample of tissue or fluid from the breast. It does not involve radiation exposure.\n\n(B) Mammography: It's an X-ray imaging technique used to detect breast cancer. It involves exposure to radiation.\n\n(C) Mastectomy: It's a surgical procedure to remove all or part of the breast. It does not involve radiation exposure.\n\n(D) Lumpectomy: It's a surgical procedure to remove a lump or portion of the breast. It does not involve radiation exposure.\n\nBased on this analysis, only option B, Mammography, involves exposure to radiation.\n\nSo, the answer is 'B'.",

            "model_answer": "(A) vary from person to person\nThis is the correct answer. Different people have different erogenous zones, and what's erogenous for one person may not be for another. People's preferences can also change over time.\n\n(B) vary for women depending on the phases of the menstrual cycle - This is not correct. While it's true that some women may experience changes in their arousal during different phases of their menstrual cycle, this is not true for all women.\n\n(C) are mainly on the lower portion of the body - This is not correct. Erogenous zones can be found all over the body for both men and women, though some areas may be more sensitive or stimulating for certain people. It's also important to note that what's erogenous for one person may not be for another.\n\n(D) all of the above - This is not correct.

            "question": "Which of the following is/are true of gonorrhea?\n\n(A) can be treated with antibiotics\n(B) has a high risk of infection with a single exposure\n(C) is asymptomatic (without symptoms) in only a small percentage of those infected\n(D) infections are limited to genital areas",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) and (C) are true of gonorrhea: \n\nGonorrhea is a common sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It can affect both men and women and is typically transmitted through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal and oral sex. Here's a breakdown of each statement:\n\n(A): Gonorrhea can generally be treated with antibiotics, but antibiotic resistance has become a growing concern. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends treating gonorrhea with a single dose of antibiotics, either ceftriaxone or azithromycin, or a combination of both. Doctors should check for resistance before prescribing treatment, as the recommended treatments might not work for all cases.\n\n(B): Gonorrhea has a high risk of infection with a single exposure, especially without proper protection, such as condoms or other barrier methods.\n\n(C): Approximately 20-40% of gonorrhea infections are asymptomatic, meaning individuals can have the infection without experiencing any symptoms. However, symptoms can occur within 2-14 days after exposure and may include painful urination, increased urinary frequency, abnormal vaginal discharge, and genital sores. It's important to note that asymptomatic individuals can still transmit the infection to others.\n\n(D): While gonorrhea infections mainly occur in the genital areas, such as the cervix, urethra, and rectum, they can also spread to other parts of the body, causing conditions such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women and epididymitis in men, which can have severe health implications if left untreated.\n\nIt's essential to be aware of the potential risk for gonorrhea and engage in safe sex practices. If you suspect you may have been exposed or are experiencing symptoms, it's crucial to seek medical attention for proper diagnosis and treatment.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "In Freudian psychology, the id is driven by instinctual and biological urges, while the superego represents a person's moral compass and sense of right and wrong. The ego plays a role in mediating between the id and the superego, trying to balance individual desires with societal expectations.\n\nIn this scenario, you were tempted by lusty, swarthy Jacques and your initial inclination was to join him at the local dairy bar. This suggests that your id (instinctual desires) was dominant at the time.\n\nSo the answer is (A) the id",

            "model_answer": "First, let's clarify that paraphilias are abnormal sexual behaviors that cause significant distress or harm to oneself or others. They are not a normal part of human sexuality.\n\nNow let's examine each of the provided options:\n\n(A) Paraphilias do not guarantee survival of the species; in fact, they can be harmful and destructive.\n\n(B) Evolutionary selection has not favored development of males who respond to novel sexual stimuli. In humans and many other mammals, sexual behaviors are highly regulated by social and cultural norms, not just biological instinct.\n\n(C) Left brain/right brain differences between genders have been debunked as a scientific explanation for any behavior. The brain is not strictly divided into left and right halves, and there are no meaningful differences in general cognitive functions between men and women.\n\n(D) Male brains are not better developed than female brains; both sexes have brains that are highly specialized for their needs and functions.\n\nBased on this analysis, none of the given options provide a valid scientific explanation for why sociobiologists believe that there are more males than females with paraphilias. The underlying cause for the gender disparity in paraphilias is complex and multifaceted, involving a combination of biological, social, and psychological factors.\n\nAnswer: (D)",

The study in question is \"Sexual scripts: Young people's accounts of sex and love\" by Sprecher, Barbee, and Schwartz (1995).\n\nA brief summary of the study's findings is that young men and women have different scripted expectations for their first sexual encounter, with men typically expecting sex to be an expression of love, while women tend to associate sex with love. The study found that women were more likely than men to report having mixed feelings after their first sexual encounter, and were more likely to report experiencing negative emotions such as regret.\n\nBased on this information, we can eliminate options (A), (B), and (D) as they do not accurately reflect the study's findings. Option (C) experienced guilt is the only answer that matches the emotions experienced by women in the study.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: (C) experienced guilt.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "According to attachment theory, a person's attachment style is characterized by how they relate to others in close relationships. There are four main attachment styles: secure, avoidant, anxious-ambivalent, and disorganized.\n\n(A) A secure lover typically feels confident in their relationships, feels comfortable expressing their emotions, and is open to intimacy. They are often able to balance their own needs with the needs of their partner and are able to handle conflict in a healthy way.\n\n(B) An avoidant lover tends to avoid intimacy and closeness, often due to feelings of anxiety and fear of being too close to someone. They may try to distance themselves from their partner or avoid expressing their emotions.\n\n(C) An anxious-ambivalent lover has a mix of anxiety and ambivalence in relationships. They desire closeness and intimacy but also feel anxious about it. This often leads to premature anger or pulling away from the partner.\n\n(D) A disorganized lover has an unstable and confusing attachment style. This can be due to trauma or negative early relationships, leading to confusion and difficulty in forming healthy, stable relationships.\n\nLooking at the information provided about Joe's relationships, we can see that his desperate advances and Helen's apparent discomfort suggest an anxious-ambivalent style. His difficulty forming close relationships with women and feeling put off by their desire for intimacy further supports this diagnosis. Therefore, based on these factors, Joe would best be described as:\n\n(C) an anxious-ambivalent lover",

However, it is not impossible.\n(B) Is probable given the enfant terrible trope. However, again, it's not the only possibility. \n(C) Is likely, given it's common for both boys to play male-typical.\nBut remember, correlation is not causation.
