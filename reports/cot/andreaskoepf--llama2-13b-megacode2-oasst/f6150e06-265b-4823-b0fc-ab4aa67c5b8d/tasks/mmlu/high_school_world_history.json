Sukarno urges Asian and African countries to work together to preserve peace and prevent their revolutions from being disrupted. The idea behind the Bandung Conference was to create a world free of armed intervention and colonialism by forming a non-aligned movement of countries that refused to align with or be polarized between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani .\n\u2014The Book of Routes and Realms , by Abu Ubaydallah al-Bakri, eleventh-century Muslim historian and geographer\nWhat evidence is there in the passage that Ghanians were engaged, directly or indirectly, in trade with Asia?\n\n(A) They kept horses in their court, which would have come from the Mongols.\n(B) The Ghanian king had adopted the Chinese tradition of the kow-tow .\n(C) The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India.\n(D) The people in his court wore silk robes.",

Let's examine each of the four answer choices provided:\n\n(A) The presence of horses in the king's court, which are thought to have originated in Asia. This suggests that there may have been some contact or trade with the Mongols, who were known for their horse breeding and warfare.\n\n(B) The adoption of the Chinese kow-tow by the Ghanian king, a gesture of respect and submission. This does not necessarily imply trade, but suggests some cultural connection or influence from Asia.\n\n(C) The king wearing gold and jewels, which could have been from India, one of the major sources of these items at the time. This could be a sign of luxury and power, but also suggests possible trade or connections with Asia.\n\n(D) The people in his court wearing silk robes, which were primarily produced in China.

Sukarno's speech emphasizes the importance of peace and the role of Asia and Africa in supporting it. However, he did not specifically mention the Cold War in his speech.\n(D) the Vietnam conflicts: The Vietnam conflicts were mainly between North and South Vietnam, which are located in Asia, and had significant regional and global implications. Sukarno did not mention these conflicts specifically in his speech, but the fact that he emphasizes the importance of peace and the role of Asia and Africa aligns with the context of the Vietnam conflicts.\n\nBased on the information provided and the analysis of the possible answers, it seems that the most appropriate answer would be:\n\n(D) the Vietnam conflicts",

He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea.

This division has had lasting effects on Korea and its people, including economic and social difficulties. While the other options listed may also be consequences of the events described, the most direct and immediate impact was the division of Korea near the 38th parallel.

He uses phrases like \"spring of hope\" and \"season of Light\" to depict a positive outlook on this period. Wordsworth, on the other hand, emphasizes the joy and beauty of being alive during this time, especially for the young\u2014though he does not explicitly mention the French Revolution.\n\n(B) Understanding, accepting:\nDickens describes the state of affairs as \"clearer than crystal\" in both England and France, suggesting that the general population understands the situation. He also uses the phrase \"for good or for evil,\" implying acceptance of the events and their consequences. Wordsworth does not explicitly comment on understanding or acceptance of the revolution; rather, he focuses on the inherent beauty of being alive during this time.\n\n(C) Cynical, enthusiastic:\nWhile Dickens describes some positive aspects of the period, such as the spring of hope and the season of Light, he also includes phrases like \"the worst of times\" and \"winter of despair.\" These expressions convey a cynical outlook on the state of affairs. Wordsworth, in contrast, is enthusiastic about the period, describing it as \"the best of times\" and \"bliss\" for being alive. However, he does not mention the French Revolution.\n\n(D) Sincere, resigned:\nBoth Dickens and Wordsworth express a sense of sincerity in their writing.

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it.

British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin.
