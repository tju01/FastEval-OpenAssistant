            "model_answer": "To find the degree of the field extension $Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))$ over $Q$, we need to determine the number of elements in this field. We can do this by counting the number of ways we can express each element in the field as a linear combination of the their irreducibly algebraic elements.\n\nRecall that $Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) = Q(\\sqrt{2 + 3 sqrt(3)})$ where $\\sqrt{2 + 3 sqrt(3)} = u + v\\sqrt{3}$ and $u^2 - 3v^2 = 2$.\n\nFirst we need to determine the Irreducible factors of the polynomial $u^2 - 3v^2$. We can do this by using the Rational Root Theorem and trial and error. The rational roots of any polynomial are of the form $\\pm p^\\frac{n-1}2$ where $p$ is a factor of the constant term and $n$ is the largest exponent of $p$. The constant term of $u^2 - 3v^2$ is 2. Therefore the possible rational roots are $\\pm 2^\\frac{n-1}2$. We can check these values to determine which one(s) are actually factors. In this case, $2^\\frac{n-1}2 = 2^\\frac{1-1}2 = 1$ is not an integer, so it is not a factor. Therefore $u^2 - 3v^2$ has two distinct finite (but complex) roots. Since these roots are both composite, we can assume without loss of generality that $u^2 - 3v^2 = (u - a)(u - b)$ where $a, b \\in \\mathbf{C}$ and the discriminant of this quadratic equation is given by $b^2 - 4ac = 2^2 - 3^2 = 1$. Thus we have the following two possibilities:\n1. $a = 1$ and $b = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{3}i$. Hence $u = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{3}i$.\n2. $a = \\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $b = \\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{3}i$. Hence $u = \\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{3}i$.\n\nWe see that each of these possibilities corresponds to a distinct complex root of $u^2 - 3v^2$, which form a basis for $Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))$ as a complex vector space. Since the roots of a polynomial are distinct in a field, $Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) \\cong \\mathbf{C}^2$. Therefore the degree of the field extension $Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))$ over $Q$ is 2.
