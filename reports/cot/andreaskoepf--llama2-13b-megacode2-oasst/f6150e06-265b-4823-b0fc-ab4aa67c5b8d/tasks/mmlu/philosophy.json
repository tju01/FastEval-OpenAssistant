It's not directly related to whether an object is essential to our existence or not. Thus, option A and C can be ruled out.\n\nWhile humans may not view all objects as essential, the fact that aesthetics is concerned with the way things look suggests that humans find value in objects that are visually appealing or harmonious. Therefore, we can also rule out option B, as aesthetics is concerned with objects that are deemed valuable by humans.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n(D) rarely viewed",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Okay, let's go through each option and analyze its validity for Nagel's claim.\n\nA. Nagel claims that most skeptical arguments are the result of applying arbitrarily stringent standards. In other words, these arguments seem very strong only because the standards being applied are very, very high. But if we were to relax these standards somewhat, the arguments would lose their force. For example, some skeptical arguments against the existence of an external world rely on very specific and demanding definitions of what it means for something to be \"physically real.\" Nagel suggests that if we were to use more moderate definitions, the strength of these skeptical arguments would be greatly diminished.\n\nB. Nagel does not claim that most skeptical arguments are based on linguistic confusions. In fact, he highlights the importance of careful and precise language when discussing these issues, and he suggests that misunderstandings can sometimes arise from imprecise or sloppy use of language. However, he does not think that linguistic confusions are the root of all skeptical arguments.\n\nC. Nagel does not claim that most skeptical arguments are logically self-refuting. Many skeptical arguments challenge our ordinary beliefs about the nature of reality, but they do not necessarily entail contradictions or self-contradictions. For example, the skeptical argument about the external world does not contradict itself, even if we grant all its premises. It simply raises a problem that needs to be sorted out.\n\nD. Nagel does not claim that most skeptical arguments grow from the consistent application of ordinary standards. While some skeptical arguments do rely on principles that are generally accepted in philosophy, Nagel suggests that the strength of these arguments comes not from their consistency with ordinary standards, but from the arbitrarily stringent standards that are applied to them. For example, as we saw in option A, some skeptical arguments rely on very demanding definitions of what it means to be \"physically real,\" definitions that go beyond what we normally expect in everyday life.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the most accurate answer to Nagel's claim is:\n\nA",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(C) establish the principles of justice for the basic structure of society.\n\nI used the definition of the \"original contract\" to come up with the answer. The original contract refers to the social contract thought experiment proposed by Rawls in which people agree to abide by the rules of society. The purpose of this hypothetical agreement is to establish a fair and just society. Therefore, the correct answer is that the original contract is to establish the principles of justice for the basic structure of society.\n\n(A) is wrong because the original contract is not about entering a particular society, but rather about establishing justice for the basic structure of society (regardless of what society that ends up being).\n\n(B) is wrong because the original contract is not specifically about setting up a form of government, but rather about establishing justice for the basic structure of society more broadly.\n\n(D) is wrong because the original contract is not about establishing the content of morality, but rather about establishing justice for the basic structure of society.",
