            "question": "The weight of an aspirin tablet is 300 milligrams according to the bottle label. An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim. Which of the following gives the P-value of this test?\n\n(A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(B) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(C) P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n(D) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Since the FDA investigator only weighs seven tablets, there are seven degrees of freedom in this hypothesis test (df = 7). The null hypothesis for this test would be that the mean weight of aspirin tablets is exactly 300 milligrams, and the alternative hypothesis would be that the mean weight is not exactly 300 milligrams. We would use a t-test to test the null hypothesis.\n\nTo calculate the P-value for this test, we could use the formula: P(t > tcritical) = 2(1 - Phi(abs(t))) where tcritical is the critical value of t for a two-tailed test with seven degrees of freedom (tcritical = 1.711), Phi(x) is the distribution function of the t-distribution with seven degrees of freedom, and abs(t) is the absolute value of the test statistic t.\n\nWe calculate the test statistic t as follows:\n\nt = (mean - hypothesized mean) / (standard deviation / sqrt(df))\nt = (299.02 + 305.00 + 302.00 + 299.01 + 301.01 + 303.03) / (0.1272 / sqrt(7))\nt = (1818.06) / (4.073)\nt \u2248 468.78\n\nSince our test statistic is greater than the critical value of t, we would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is evidence that the mean weight of aspirin tablets is not exactly 300 milligrams. To find the P-value, we plug the value of abs(t) into the formula:\n\nP(t > 1.711) = 2(1 - Phi(468.78))\nP(t > 1.711) = 2(1 - 0.99999997)\nP(t > 1.711) \u2248 0.00000003\n\nSince this P-value is extremely small, we could also express it as 0.0000000299 (rounded to six decimal places). There is no option in the choices given that matches either of these P-values exactly, so none of the provided options are the correct answer. However, the closest option to our calculated P-value is (A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6, which is still slightly smaller than the P-value we calculated.",

            "model_answer": "Okay, let's analyze the different possibilities step-by-step:\n\n1. If they modify their experiment to use twice as many experimental units for each treatment, the number of experimental units in each treatment group would increase by a factor of 2.\n\n2. For the Null Hypothesis to be false, it implies that there is an effect in the experiment. Increasing the number of experimental units for each treatment group should allow for a more precise estimate of the effect size.\n\n3. A Type I error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true. This would mean that we are claiming that there is an effect when there is actually none. Increasing the sample size should make it less likely that we make this mistake.\n\n4. Power is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually false. Increasing the sample size should also increase the power of the experiment, meaning that we are more likely to detect a true effect when it exists.\n\nNow, let's look at the different options:\n\n(A) The probability of a Type I error and the probability of a Type II error would both decrease.\nThis option is not necessarily correct, as Type I and Type II errors are related to different scenarios. Decreasing the Type I error probability ( improving the significance level) does not inherently affect the Type II error probability.\n\n(B) The probability of a Type I error and the power would both increase.\nThis option is also not correct. Increasing the sample size would decrease the Type I error probability (increase the significance level) but would not necessarily increase the power. The power is related to detecting an effect, not to rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\n(C) The probability of a Type II error and the power would both increase.\nThis option is the most correct answer, as it addresses both consequences of increasing the sample size. The probability of a Type II error (failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false) would decrease since we are more likely to detect an effect, and the power of the experiment would increase as we have more experimental units to estimate the effect size.\n\n(D) The probability of a Type I error would stay the same and the power would increase.\nThis option is only partially correct.
