            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze the sets of integers step-by-step and determine which set could possibly be the set of all common divisors of two integers.\n\nFirst, let's look at each set:\n\n(A) {-6,-2, -1, 1, 2, 6}\n(B) {-6, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 6}\n(C) {-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6}\n(D) {-6, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6}\n\nThen, we need to determine if these sets contain all common divisors of any two integers. A divisor is a number which when divided by another number leaves a quotient with no remainder. In other words, a common divisor divides both integers without leaving a remainder.\n\nNow let's analyze each set:\n\n(A) We can check if this set contains all divisors of integers {3, 5}. We see that {3, 5} has no common divisor, since it's not possible to divide either 3 or 5 by the other number without leaving a remainder. Therefore, there is at least one integer for which this set is not the set of all denominators (3 in this case).\n\n(B) Similar to set (A), we can check if this set contains all divisors of integers {2, 4}. Here, we also find that this set is not the set of all denominators (since 2 and 4 are not both divisible by any number in the set).\n\n(C) Again, let's check if this set contains all divisors of integers {6, -8}. In this case, we find that this set is not the set of all denominators (since -8 is not divisible by any of the numbers in the set).\n\n(D) Finally, let's check if this set contains all divisors of integers {9, 12}. In this case, we can see that this set is not the set of all denominators.\n\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that none of the sets are the set of all common divisors of two integers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n(A) No",

Since they are all multiplied by integers, the only variable that affects the ratios is disk transfer time. Because version 2 reads twice the size of blocks as version 1, it requires only half the number of disk read operations to retrieve the same amount of data. So, in terms of disk transfer time, version 2 takes half the time as version 1, since the transfer is spread across half the number of blocks.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\ndisk transfer time * 2 = disk transfer time + disk transfer time\n2 * disk transfer time = 2 * disk transfer time\ndisk transfer time = 0\n\nNow, substituting this into our ratio:\n\nratio = (disk seek time + disk latency time + 0 + operating system overhead + operating system overhead) / (disk seek time + disk latency time + 0/2 + operating system overhead + operating system overhead)\n\nratio = (disk seek time + disk latency time + operating system overhead * 2) / (disk seek time + disk latency time + operating system overhead)\n\nratio \u2248 2\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately (A) 1:4.",
