To do this, we need to map each vertex onto the line y = x. This can be done by looking at the equation of the line and figuring out how to transform each vertex onto it.\n\nTo reflect the first vertex, (\u20132, \u20134), across the line y = x, we need to transform it by shifting it up by y = x and then flipping it horizontally.\n\nSo, the transformed vertex is: (\u20132, \u20134) + (0, 1) = (-2 + 0, \u20134 + 1) = (-2, 3) (This is because we shift the vertex up by y = x, which is 1, and then flip it horizontally.)\n\nSimilarly, we can reflect the other vertices onto the line y = x as follows:\n\n(\u20134, 1) + (0, 1) = (-4 + 0, 1 + 1) = (-4, 2) (This is because we shift the vertex up by y = x, which is 1, and then flip it horizontally.)\n(-1, 4) + (1, 1) = (\u20131 + 1, 4 + 1) = (0, 5) (This is because we shift the vertex up by y = x, which is 1, and then flip it horizontally.)\n(2, 4) + (0, 1) = (2 + 0, 4 + 1) = (2, 5) (This is because we shift the vertex up by y = x, which is 1, and then flip it horizontally.)\n(3, 0) + (1, 1) = (3 + 1, 0 + 1) = (4, 1) (This is because we shift the vertex up by y = x, which is 1, and then flip it horizontally.)\n\nNow, we can compare the five vertices of P\u2019 (the new pentagon after reflection) with the five vertices of P to find the correct answer.\n\nThe five vertices of P\u2019 are: (0, \u20133), (4, 1), (2, 2), (\u20134, \u20132), and (\u20132, 3).\n\nWe can eliminate some of these vertices based on their coordinates:\n\n(0, \u20133) is not one of the vertices of P, since it does not match up with any of the coordinates of the vertices of P.\n\n(4, 1) is not one of the vertices of P, since it does not match up with any of the coordinates of the vertices of P.\n\n(\u20134, \u20132) is not one of the vertices of P, since it does not match up with any of the coordinates of the vertices of P.\n\nSo, we are left with the following four vertices: (2, 2), (2, 5), (\u20132, 3), and (\u20132, 3).\n\nOf these four vertices, only (2, 2) matches up with all of the coordinates of the vertices of P: (\u20132, \u20134), (\u20134, 1), (-1, 4), (2, 4), and (3, 0).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (2, 2).",
