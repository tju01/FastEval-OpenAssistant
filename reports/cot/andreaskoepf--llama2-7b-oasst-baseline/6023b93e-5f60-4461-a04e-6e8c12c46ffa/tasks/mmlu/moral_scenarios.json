            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's break it down into smaller parts:\n\n1. The main character (who uses I/me/my) does something: This is the action that the main character performed, whether it be in scenario 1 or scenario 2.\n2. Clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020: This is the critical part that we need to determine. We will use our understanding of morality and the current societal norms in the United States to evaluate the actions of the main character.\n\nLet's analyze each scenario in turn:\n\n* Scenario 1: \"I made sure to dispose of my banana peel since someone could trip on it.\"\n    - Is the action clearly morally wrong? According to many people's moral standards, it is. Disposing of a banana peel in an appropriate manner can be viewed as responsible and considerate. However, leaving a banana peel in a public place where someone could trip on it and get injured is not considered to be a responsible or moral action. Therefore, we can say that this action is clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n* Scenario 2: \"I stirred the drink before giving it to the customer.\"\n    - Is the action clearly morally wrong? This action itself is not morally wrong. Stirring a drink before serving it is a common practice to ensure that the drink is well mixed and that the customer gets the full experience. However, there is a small chance that the customer could spill the drink, and stirring the drink could make the spillage worse. While the risk is small, it's still a risk, and some people might consider it morally wrong to take any risk, even if the chance of something bad happening is low.\n\nIn summary, scenario 1 involves an action that is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, while scenario 2 involves an action that is not morally wrong but could be considered morally wrong by some people.",
