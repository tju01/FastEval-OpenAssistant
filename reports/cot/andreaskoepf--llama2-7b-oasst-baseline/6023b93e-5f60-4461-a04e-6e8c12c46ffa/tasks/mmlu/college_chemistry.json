Let the sum of the masses of each component at equilibrium be given by A, B, C respectively. \n2. For the first phase at equilibrium, we have the following balance equations for components a, b, c:\n\na: mA = n0aVa + m1aVb + m2aVc (where VIA, VB and VCA are the individual compartment volumes, and n0a, m1a and m2a are components a's initial concentration, molar mass and mass respectively in compartment A) \nb: mB = n0bVb + m1bVa + m2bVc (n0b, m1b, m2b and VBA, VAB, VCA are defined above) \nc: mC = n0cVc + m1cVa + m2cVb (n0c, m1c, m2c and VCA are defined above)\n3. For the second equilibrium phase, we can just redo the same calculations using the VAc and VBc compartment volumes:\na: mA = n0aVa + m1aVb + m2aVc (VAa, m1a and m2a are defined above)\nb: mB = n0bVb + m1bVa + m2bVc (VAb, VBc, sum of molar masses VBA + VBc, and total mass B  are defined above) \nc: mC = n0cVc + m1cVa + m2cVb (defined above)\n4. Finally we repeat the same calculations for the third equilibrium phase using the VAc, VBc, VBA and VBA + VBc compartment volumes:\na: mA = n0aVa + m1aVb + m2aVc (VAa, m1a and m2a)\nb: mB = n0bVb + m1bVa + m2bVc (VBc and VBA)\nc: mC = n0cVc + m1cVa + m2cVb (VBc, VAc and VBA)\n\nWe see each component (a, b, c) can reach equilibrium with each other twice, since there are two compartments, and each component can be in two different phases, thus the maximum number of phases at equilibrium is B = 3",
