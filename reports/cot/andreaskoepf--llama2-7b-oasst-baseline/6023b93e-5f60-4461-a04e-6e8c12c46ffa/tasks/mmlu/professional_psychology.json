            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the theory of cognitive development put forward by Jean Piaget. According to his theory, children are not \"blank slates\" but rather have innate cognitive abilities that develop and change over time. Theyare \"little scientists\" who actively explore their environment and draw conclusions based on their observations.Culture plays a role in shaping children's cognitive development, but it is not the only factor.\n\nTherefore, Option C: \"Little scientists\" is the correct answer.",

            "model_answer": "The question presents us with a hypothetical scenario where a test has a standard error of measurement of 15 points. We are asked to choose between four possible conclusions about the test's performance.\n\nThe first conclusion is that \"(A) about 68% of the observed scores for the test population lie within 15 points of the mean score.\" This statement is true, as the standard error of measurement represents the amount of variation in scores that is due to sampling error, rather than differences in true scores. Therefore, if scores are sampled from a population, about 68% of the observed scores will be within 15 points of the mean score.\n\nThe second conclusion is that \"(B) about 68% of the individuals with a given cure score will have observed scores within 15 points of the true score.\" This is also true, as the statement assumes that scores are sampled from a population and that the true scores are known.\n\nThe third conclusion is that \"(C) about 15% of the scores are in error (i.e., they are not measuring the trait reliably).\" This statement is not necessarily true, as it depends on the true scores and the accuracy of the measurement. If the standard error of measurement is 15 points, then 15% of the scores could potentially be in error, but this does not necessarily mean that the test is not measuring the trait reliably.\n\nThe fourth and final conclusion is that \"(D) differences of up to 30 points represent the same true score.\" This statement is not necessarily true, as it depends on the true scores and the accuracy of the measurement. If the standard error of measurement is 15 points, then differences of up to 30 points could potentially represent different true scores.",

It is not a substance that can have a negative impact on fetal development.\n\nA controlled substance: This refers to substances that are regulated by law due to their potential for abuse or harm. While controlled substances can have adverse effects on individuals, they are not necessarily linked to fetal development.\n\nOnly a problem in the first 6 weeks: This option implies that issues only arise during the first 6 weeks of fetal development, which is not accurate.

First, let's consider which of the options is most closely associated with decline in memory functioning in general.\n   Some possibilities are:\n    - the efficiency of controlled memory processes (e.g., rehearsal)\n    - metamemory skills, or knowledge about memory\n    - recognition memory\n    - the amount of factual memory knowledge available\n\n2. Now, let's consider the role that memory plays in everyday life. For most people, memory is essential for navigating the world and getting things done. This suggests that:\n   - _metamemory skills, or knowledge about memory_ are key because they help us assess our own memory performance and adjust our strategies accordingly.\n\n3.
