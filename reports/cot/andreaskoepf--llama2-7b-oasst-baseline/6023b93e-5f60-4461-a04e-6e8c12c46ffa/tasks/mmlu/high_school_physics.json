            "model_answer": "Capacitance (C) is defined as the amount of charge that will be stored on the plates when a potential difference of 1 V is applied across the capacitor. Therefore, we can use Coulomb's Law, which states that the charge on a single plate of a capacitor is given by Q = CV, where Q is the charge in Coulombs (C), V is the potential difference in volts (V), and C is the capacitance in farads (F).\n\nSince we are given a capacitance of 2 mF, we can convert this to F using the following formula:\n\n1 mF = 10-3 F\n\nSince we are given a potential difference of 5 V, we can use Ohm's Law, which states that the current flowing through a circuit is given by I = V/R, where I is the current in amperes (A), V is the potential difference in volts (V), and R is the resistance in ohms (\u03a9).\n\nSince we does not have a known resistance, we can ignore Ohm's Law and focus solely on Coulomb's Law. Therefore, we can plug in the values we know (Q = CV, V = 5 V, C = 2 mF) into Coulomb's Law and solve for Q:\n\nQ = CV\nQ = 5 V * 2 mF\nQ = 10 C\n\nThe correct answer is (D), 10 C.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Explanation:\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the behavior of the electric field around the solid, metal object.\n\nWhen charge is distributed on the surface of an object, it creates an electric field that extends outward from that surface. The electric field outside the object is not zero, as option (A) suggests. Instead, it is affected by the non-uniform charge distribution on the object's surface.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because the electric field inside and outside the object are not necessarily equal. The distribution of charge on the object's surface can create a net electric field inside and outside the object, which may be different.\n\nOption (C) considers the relationship between the electric field and the distance from the object's center of mass. However, the electric field outside the object depends not only on the distance, but also on the distribution of charge on the surface. A non-uniform charge distribution can create fields that are not directly proportional to the distance.\n\nOnly option (D) correctly considers the relationship between the electric field and the distribution of charge on the object's surface. Near the object's surface, the electric field is directly proportional to the surface charge density. However, as the distance from the surface increases, the electric field will decay due to the limited extent of the distribution of charge on the object's surface. The overall electric field at large distances from the object will still be influenced by the distribution of charge on the surface.",

To determine if this answer is correct, I need to know what happens when the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\n7. When the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, the net force acting on it is -kA.

The magnitude of the acceleration is given by a = -kA/m.\n\n9.
