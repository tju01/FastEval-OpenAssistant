Let's start with (C).\n\nOption (C): \"Idea-oriented\" campaigns are designed to promote a specific idea or message. They don't focus on selling a product or individual, but on raising awareness and encouraging support for a certain cause.\nFor example, a campaign to raise awareness for breast cancer might focus on sharing information about the disease, its symptoms, and possible treatments, without explicitly promoting a particular brand of products or services.\n\nOption (D): \"Message-oriented\" campaigns are also focused on promoting a specific idea or message, but they may not necessarily be \"idea-oriented\" in the same sense as option (C).\nFor example, a campaign to promote a new product might focus on the benefits and features of the product, without explicitly discussing the cause or message behind it.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is \"Message-oriented\".",

Based on this analysis, the public relations counselor can help the organization create a vision statement that articulates its goals, values, and aspirations for the future. The vision statement serves as a guide for the organization's actions and helps it create a compelling narrative that resonates with stakeholders. By reviewing present and future realities on a regular basis, the public relations counselor helps ensure that the organization is aligned with its core values and has a clear understanding of its direction for growth and success.",

This phenomenon is described by sociologist Erving Goffman and refers to the tendency for people to conform to the opinions of the majority, even if they hold different beliefs. This can lead to a reduction in the visibility and expression of minority views, which in turn reinforces the perception that the majority opinion is the correct one.",
