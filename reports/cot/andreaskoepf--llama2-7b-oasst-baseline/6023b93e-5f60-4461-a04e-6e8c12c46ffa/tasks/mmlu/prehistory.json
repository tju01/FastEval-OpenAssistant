            "question": "Unlike most other early civilizations, Minoan culture shows little evidence of:\n\n(A) trade.\n(B) warfare.\n(C) the development of a common religion.\n(D) conspicuous consumption by elites.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Firstly, we need to eliminate the incorrect options.\n\nOption (A) - Trade: Minoan culture shows evidence of trade through the discovery of trade routes and the production of goods such as pottery and jewelry for export. This is evident through the discovery of seals, sealings, and tablets with commercial writing recordings trade transactions. Option (A) is therefore incorrect.\n\nOption (B) - Warfare: Although military-related sectors have been found in my research such as Linear B tablets recording numbers of chariots, cavalry and infantry, Minoan society is generally regarded as being pacifistic. For example, Linear B tablets show no evidence of military action and there is no evidence of major fortifications or weapons during this period. Minoan culture is generally NOT characterized by warfare. Option (B) is therefore incorrect.\n\nOption (C) - The Development of a Common Religion: Minoan culture is known to have a polytheistic religion with Goddesses and Gods such as Pasiphae, Daidalos and Minos. Further information was gained from finding terra-cotta statues, tablets with religious texts and large architectural religious structures. However, no evidence of Common religious practices between Minoan cities have been discovered, thus option (C) is also incorrect.\n\nOption (D) - Conspicuous Consumption by Elites: Although there is evidence of elites having luxury goods such as jewelry and pottery, this was not exclusively for themselves, as the wealthy often passed these goods on in burials for the afterlife. Further evidence of elite consumption is provided by Linear B tablets recording the production and purchase of luxury goods. Elites wealth was used to build monumental sites and palaces. Whilst Conspicuous consumption is true, it was not exclusive to the elite, and option (D) is therefore incorrect.\n\nTherefore the correct answer is:\n\n(B) Warfare",

Option (B) highlights the use of slaves and the threat of death for their construction.

            "model_answer": "The Hopewell were complex rank societies, but they were not a state. Hopewell culture lacked all of the following elements EXCEPT:\n\n(D) a permanent military.\n\nIn order to answer this question, let's look at each element and determine what they mean and how they are related to the concept of a state.\n\n1. Formal government: This refers to a system of governance that is organized and structured, with clearly defined roles and responsibilities for leaders and officials. A state typically has a formal government that provides regulatory, economic, and legal services to its citizens.\n\n2. Monumental earthworks: These refer to large-scale construction projects, such as mounds, ditches, and canals, that are intended to have a significant visual or symbolic impact. These types of works are often associated with states and their desire to demonstrate power and wealth to their subjects.\n\n3. Urban centers: This refers to densely populated areas that have developed around cities or centers of trade and commerce. Urban centers typically have a variety of economic, social, and political functions, and are often a hallmark of states.\n\n4. Permanent military: This refers to a standing army or force that is trained and equipped to defend a state and its interests. States typically maintain a permanent military to ensure their security and power projection.\n\nBy looking at each element and its place in a state system, we can see that (D) a permanent military is the only element that is not present in Hopewell culture. States typically have a permanent military to ensure their security and power projection, and this is a key element of statehood.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) a permanent military.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "After consideration, I can conclude that the correct answer is:\n\n(C) it allowed for subsequent growth of the brain, since bipedalism had resulted in a narrowed birth canal in the female pelvis.\n\nThe evolutionary solution of the secondarily altricial condition of modern human babies may have been influenced by several factors, outlined below:\n\n(B) it allowed for bipedalism and independence from the mother at an earlier age: This factor could have played a role in promoting the development of human babies' cognitive and physical abilities, as they were able to move around and explore their environments at an earlier age.\n\nHowever, it is unlikely that this factor alone would have been sufficient to drive the evolution of the condition, as other primates also have relatively large brain sizes for their body size, yet do not exhibit this condition.\n\n(A) the brain size of hominids had not grown for more than a million years, making it difficult for babies to walk: While brain size may have been an important factor in driving the evolution of hominids, it is unlikely that the brain size alone would have been a significant barrier to walking. Many mammals, including primates, have large brains that allow them to walk on two legs, and brain size alone is not a convincing explanation for the evolution of the secondarily altricial condition.\n\n(C) it allowed for subsequent growth of the brain, since bipedalism had resulted in a narrowed birth canal in the female pelvis: This factor may have played a more significant role in influencing the evolution of the condition. Bipedalism resulted in a narrowed birth canal in the female pelvis, which may have made it more difficult for large-brained human babies to pass through the birth canal. By allowing for subsequent growth of the brain prior to birth, the condition may have provided an evolutionary advantage by allowing the brain to grow to adult size while minimizing the risk of injury during childbirth. This factor is more persuasive as an evolutionary explanation for the condition.\n\nIn summary, while factors (B) and (A) may have played some role in the evolution of the secondarily altricial condition of modern human babies, factor (C) is a more convincing explanation. By allowing for subsequent growth of the brain prior to birth, bipedalism resulted in a narrowed birth canal in the female pelvis, which likely drove the evolution of the condition as an adaptation to the demands of bipedalism and the limitations imposed by the birth canal.",

This transition suggests that ancient hominids were adapting to a more varied diet, including more nuts and fruits. This shift in diet may have been linked to changes in plant communities, as different plants require different environments and nutrients to thrive. This may have led to a change in the available food sources for ancient hominids, prompting them to adapt their diet to include more nuts and fruits.",
