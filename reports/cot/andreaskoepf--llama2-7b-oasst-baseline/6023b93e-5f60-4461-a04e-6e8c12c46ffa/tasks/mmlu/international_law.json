            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "In the context of crimes committed on board vessels, the term \"State\" generally refers to a country or sovereign entity that has jurisdiction over its territory and its citizens. There are generally two ways in which a State can exercise jurisdiction over a crime committed on board a vessel:\n\n1. Nationality principle: If the vessel is flagged (registered) in a certain State, then that State has jurisdiction over crimes committed on board the vessel, regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator or the victim. This is known as the \"flag State's\" jurisdiction.\n2. Territorial principle: If the crime occurs on the territorial waters or the exclusive economic zone of a certain State, then that State has jurisdiction over the crime, regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator or the vessel. This is known as the \"coastal State's\" jurisdiction.\n\nFrom the given options, it can be deduced that the correct answer is \"(B) The flag State\".",

            "model_answer": "Justiciability refers to whether a particular right can be enforced in a court of law. It is a legal concept that determines whether a case involving a constitutional, statutory, or international right can be heard by a court for the purpose of adjudicating its merits. The meaning of justiciability is that a right must be ripe for adjudication, meaning that it must be both concrete and presently available to the party seeking relief. This means that the right must be actual and not speculative, and that the party seeking relief must have a real interest in enforcing the right.",

            "question": "In what way is Responsibility to Protect (R2P) different from humanitarian intervention?\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "R2P and humanitarian intervention differ in several ways, including:\n\nPurpose: The primary objective of R2P is to prevent and halt genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing. On the other hand, humanitarian intervention is typically carried out to address humanitarian crises and provide relief to those in need, without necessarily addressing the root causes of the crisis.\n\nInvolvement of the UN Security Council (UNSC): R2P emphasizes the role of the UNSC in addressing situations of mass atrocities. The UNSC can make binding decisions to ensure States fulfill their responsibilities to protect their populations. Humanitarian intervention, however, does not necessarily require UNSC authorization, although it may seek such authorization.\n\nTypes of intervention: R2P allows for a range of interventions, including peacekeeping, peacekeeping, and military responses, depending on the severity of the crisis and the capacity of the State to protect its population. Humanitarian intervention, on the other hand, typically involves military intervention to provide relief and protection to those in need.\n\nCall for assistance: In contrast to R2P, humanitarian intervention can occur without a call for assistance from the State in distress.\n\nPrimary responsibility of States: R2P recognizes the primary responsibility of States to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing. However, if a State is unable or unwilling to do so, the international community has a responsibility to intervene. Humanitarian intervention, on the other hand, primarily aims to provide relief to those in need, regardless of the responsibility of the State.",

            "model_answer": "The \"Lotus principle\" is a legal doctrine in international law that is often associated with the case of the SS Lotus, a British ship that was seized by French authorities in the Horn of Africa in 1886. The principle stems from the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) in the Lotus case, which held that \"whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law.\"\n\nIn other words, the Lotus principle holds that any action that is not specifically prohibited by international law is permissible and may be taken by States. This principle has been interpreted broadly by some authors and has been used to justify a variety of actions taken by States in international relations, including the use of force, the establishment of tariffs, and the enforcement of treaties.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"What is the Lotus principle?\" is (A) The so-called Lotus principle is that \"whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law.\"",

The Human Rights Committee is responsible for interpreting the provisions of the ICCPR and monitoring its implementation by states parties. It provides advice and recommendations to states on how to implement their human rights obligations under the ICCPR, and can receive and consider individual complaints from people who claim their human rights have been violated by a state party to the ICCPR.\n    The other options mentioned, i.e. UN Human Rights Council (Option B), UN Universal Periodic Review (Option C) and UN special mandates (Option D) are not treaty-based human rights mechanisms, but rather are bodies or processes within the UN system that are designed to promote and protect human rights on a global scale.
