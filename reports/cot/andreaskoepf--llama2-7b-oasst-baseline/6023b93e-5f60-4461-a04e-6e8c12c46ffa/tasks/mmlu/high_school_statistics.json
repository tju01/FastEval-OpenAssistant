            "question": "The weight of an aspirin tablet is 300 milligrams according to the bottle label. An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim. Which of the following gives the P-value of this test?\n\n(A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(B) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(C) P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n(D) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The question asks us to find the P-value of a hypothesis test conducted on the weight of aspirin tablets. The null hypothesis states that the weight of an aspirin tablet is 300 milligrams, and the alternative hypothesis states that the weight varies from 300 milligrams.\n\nTo determine the P-value, we will use a one-sample t-test. The test statistic t is calculated as:\n\nt = (\u03bc - \u03bc0) / \u03c3\n\nwhere \u03bc is the mean weight of our sample, \u03bc0 is the null hypothesis mean of 300 milligrams, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the sample weights.\n\nSince we have seven sample weights, we have seven degrees of freedom (df = 7).\n\nThe critical value t* is calculated using the student t distribution function with 7 degrees of freedom and a significance level of \u03b1 = 0.05.\n\nWe will use the t.test() function in R to conduct the test. Here is an example code in R:\n\n`t.test(x = sample weights, mu = 300, alternative = \"greater\")\n`\nThe output of the t.test() function will give us the test statistic t and its corresponding P-value. The P-value is a measure of the likelihood of observing a result as extreme as ours under the null hypothesis.\n\nIn this case, the test statistic t = 1.54 and the P-value is:\n\nP(t > 1.54) with df = 7 = 0.1017\n\nTherefore, since the P-value is greater than \u03b1 = 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. In other words, we cannot conclude that the weight of aspirin tablets is not 300 milligrams.",

            "model_answer": "To calculate the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders, we need to find the range of waiting times that includes 100,000 riders. Since we know the mean (35 minutes) and standard deviation (10 minutes), we can use the formula for the standard normal distribution:\n\nx = z*sd + mean\n\nwhere z is a standard normal random variable (with a standard deviation of 1) and sd is the standard deviation of the waiting times.\n\nWe can substitute in the values for sd and mean:\n\n100,000 = z*10 + 35\n\nWe can solve for z:\n\nz = (100,000-35)/10 = 9650/10 = 96.5\n\nNow we can use the standard normal table to find the range of waiting times that includes z = 96.5:\n\nRange = z - 1.96 standard deviations + 1.96 standard deviations\nRange = 96.5 - 1.96 standard deviations + 1.96 standard deviations\nRange = 94.55 to 98.45 minutes\n\nTherefore, the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders is from 94.55 to 98.45 minutes.",

            "model_answer": "(C)\n\nThe mean of a discrete random variable is calculated by adding up all the possible outcomes and dividing by the number of possible outcomes. The expected value is a measure of the average value that a random variable is expected to take on, and it does not depend on the probability distribution of the random variable.\n\nHowever, the formula for calculating the expected value of a discrete random variable does not involve the product of each value and its corresponding probability. Instead, it involves the sum of the values multiplied by their corresponding probabilities. Therefore, statement (C) is incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, statement (D) is also incorrect, as it is not true that approximately 95% of the outcomes of a discrete random variable will fall within two standard deviations of the mean. The standard deviation is a measure of the variation in a distribution, and it can be larger or smaller than two standard deviations depending on the shape of the distribution. It is possible for a discrete random variable to have outcomes that are all very close to the mean, but still have a large standard deviation.\n\nTherefore, the only incorrect statement among the choices given is statement (C).",

            "model_answer": "I will explain my reasoning step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's define some terms:\n\n- Type I error: rejecting the true null hypothesis when it is actually true (an incorrect rejection of the null hypothesis).\n- Type II error: failing to reject the false null hypothesis when it is actually false (an incorrect failure to reject the null hypothesis).\n- Power: the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually false.\n\nNow, let's think about what would happen if the researchers modify their experiment to use twice as many experimental units for each treatment:\n\n(A) The probability of a Type I error and the probability of a Type II error would both decrease.\nThis is not correct.

The probability of a Type I error and the probability of a Type II error are based on the false null hypothesis, which would remain unchanged by doubling the experimental units for each treatment.\n\n(B) The probability of a Type I error and the power would both increase.\nThis is correct. Power increases as the sample size increases, because the sample size gives us more information to reject the null hypothesis.

Adding twice as many experimental units would increase power by increasing the sample size.\n\n(C) The probability of a Type II error and the power would both increase.\nThis is also correct. Power increases as the sample size increases, so adding twice as many experimental units would increase power. However, power is only increased because the false null hypothesis increases in power. The probability of a Type II error would also increase because the increase in sample size makes it easier to reject the false null hypothesis.\n\n(D) The probability of a Type I error would stay the same and the power would increase.\nThis is not correct. Power increases because the sample size increases. The probability of a Type I error is not affected by the change in sample size, so this is not a correct option.",
