            "model_answer": "The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is an organizational body within the United Nations that is responsible for maintaining international peace and security. It is composed of 15 members, including five permanent members (US, UK, Russia, China and France) and 10 non-permanent members, who are elected by the General Assembly for a two-year term.\n\nThe permanent members of the UNSC have veto power, which means they can Block or Override resolutions passed by the council. The non-permanent members do not have veto power.\n\nThe UNSC can adopt resolutions by a majority of its members present and voting. A resolution requires nine affirmative votes to be adopted, and a negative vote by any of the five permanent members (veto) can block its adoption.\n\nThe rotating members of the UNSC are elected for a two-year term, and each member takes turns serving on the council for one month of each year.",

            "model_answer": "The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was a significant event in US history that had far-reaching consequences for both the Vietnam War and US foreign policy in general. The resolution gave President Lyndon B. Johnson the authorization to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against US forces in Southeast Asia.\n\nAt the time, North Vietnamese torpedo boats had attacked two US destroyers, the USS Maddox and the USS Turner Joy, in the Gulf of Tonkin. The Johnson administration used this incident as a pretext to request a congressional authorization for military action in Vietnam.\n\nThe resolution passed overwhelmingly in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, with only a handful of dissenting votes. This showed the unwavering support for the Vietnam War among US lawmakers and the American public.\n\nHowever, later investigation revealed that the incident was in fact a false flag attack instigated by the Johnson administration itself to justify military escalation in Vietnam. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, therefore, had far-reaching consequences beyond the Vietnam War itself. It represented a shift in the way the US government wielded its military power and shaped its foreign policy.",

            "correct_answer": 3,

It is usually focused on illegal activities such as drug trafficking, money laundering, and extortion. Although organized crime groups can pose a threat to society, they are typically Ukraine Brides Review insufficient to be considered as a nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States.\n\nC) Drug traffickers: Drug traffickers are individuals or organizations that traffic in controlled substances for financial gain. Although drug trafficking is illegal and can cause harm to individuals and society, it is not typically considered a threat to national security, especially on a state level. States typically lack the capacity to pose a direct threat to other states, as it is not in their interests to do so. Drug traffickers may collaborate with other nonstate actors to achieve their objectives, but they are not a threat in themselves.\n\nD) China: China is not a nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States. While China is a geopolitical rival of the United States and has its own interests and agenda, it is not an actor that operates outside the structure of the state and cannot be considered a nonstate actor. Countries typically exercise power and influence through state institutions, such as their military, diplomatic corps, and economic policies. China may collaborate with nonstate actors to achieve its objectives, but it does so through state institutions.\n\n> only afterwards output the answer:\n>\n> The final line should contain the answer as a single letter with parenthesis without anything else.\n>\n> The answer is: (D) China",

He advocated for public works projects, Social Security, and other programs to address domestic issues rather than relying on international agreements or alliances. However, he also recognized the interconnected nature of the global economy and believed that international cooperation was necessary to address the economic and political challenges facing the United States and the world.\n\n(C): Roosevelt was indeed an isolationist who believed in keeping the US out of international conflicts and disputes. However, this isolated stance did not mean that he was against international cooperation or negotiation when it benefited the US.\n\nOverall, Roosevelt's initial isolationist stance during the 1930s was a result of a combination of factors, including his belief in domestic reform, his recognition of the interconnected nature of the global economy, and his preference for non-interventionist foreign policy.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The \"New Populism\" refers to a political movement that emerged in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was a response to the economic and social changes brought about by industrialization and urbanization. Populists believed that the interests of the wealthy and powerful had come at the expense of working-class Americans, and they advocated for government intervention to protect the rights and interests of the common man.\n\nThe New Populism was characterized by a strong emphasis on the power of the people and a rejection of the elite. Populists believed that working-class Americans should have a voice in the political process, and they called for the direct election of senators, the abolition of the gold standard, and the nationalization of railroads.\n\nWhile the New Populism was a response to the economic and social changes brought about by industrialization, it is not accurately characterized as a strand of neo-isolationist sentiment, a strand of internationalist sentiment, an expression of American cultural superiority, or increased incorporation of public opinion in foreign policy making. Instead, it was a political movement that aimed to protect the rights and interests of working-class Americans and to give them a greater voice in the political process.",
