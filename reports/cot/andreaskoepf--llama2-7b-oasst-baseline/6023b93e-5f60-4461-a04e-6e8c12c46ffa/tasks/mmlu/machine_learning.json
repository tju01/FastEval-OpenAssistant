            "model_answer": "We can approach this question by first understanding what each statement means, and then applying basic principles of statistics to check if they are true or false.\n\n statement 1:\n\nLinear regression estimator is a method of fitting a line to a set of data points and estimating a numerical parameter (usually a slope or intercept) that best fits the data. It is one of several unbiased estimators available for the parameter of interest.\n\nWhat does \"unbiased estimator\" mean? An unbiased estimator is an estimate of a parameter that does not tend to underestimate or overestimate the actual value of the parameter. This means that the estimate will on average be close to the true value of the parameter.\n\nSo, \"linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators\" means that among all unbiased estimators for the parameter of interest, linear regression has the lowest variability or uncertainty in its estimate. This is a way of saying that linear regression is a robust and reliable method for estimating the parameter in question.\n\nStatement 2:\n\nThe AdaBoost algorithm is a machine learning algorithm that assembles a series of weak classifiers and combines their outputs to form a strong classifier. The classifiers themselves are trained on a dataset using a variety of techniques, such as support vector machines, decision trees, or random forests.\n\nWhat does \"non-negative\" mean in this context? It means that the coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers in AdaBoost's final classifier network are always positive or zero, rather than negative. This means that the final classifier will always favor positive examples over negative examples, rather than being able to distinguish between the two types of examples equally well.\n\nNow let's combine our understanding of these two statements to answer the question.\n\nIf statement 1 is true, that means that linear regression is an unbiased estimator among all other unbiased estimators.\n\nIf statement 2 is false, that means that the coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers in AdaBoost can be negative, which would create a classifier that is biased towards misclassifying negative examples as positive examples.\n\nSince statement 2 is not true, we can conclude that statement 1 must also be false, as it would not be possible for linear regression to be an unbiased estimator if the coefficients in AdaBoost can be negative.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (D): False, True.",

How decision tree learns by minimizing information gain?\nDecision tree learns by minimizing information gain at each split. At each split, the tree splits the given dataset along a variable or its subset, and the split should improve the gain of information. The decision tree learns by recursively splitting variables or their subsets until the minimum attainable information gain is reached.\n\nTherefore, statement 2 is False.\n\nCombining both statements, we get:\n\n(A) False, False",
