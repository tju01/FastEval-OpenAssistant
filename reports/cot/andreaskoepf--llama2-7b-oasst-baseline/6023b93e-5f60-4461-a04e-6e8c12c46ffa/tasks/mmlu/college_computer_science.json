            "model_answer": "Option A is correct. The access matrix approach to protection has the difficulty that the matrix, if stored directly, can be large and clumsy to manage. This is because the matrix needs to store information about the relationships between processes and resources, as well as the access rights of each process. This can make it difficult to manage and maintain the matrix over time, and can result in a large amount of storage space being required. There are ways to reduce the size of the matrix, such as using compression algorithms, but this still adds complexity to the design.",

            "model_answer": "Let's reason step-by-step:\n\n1. We start with given sets: (A), (B), (C), and (D).\n2. Since common divisor is an integer, its value must be non-negative. So we can remove negative values from the set {(-6,-2,-1,1,2,6)}: {6} and {2}.\n3. If a set contains both even and odd numbers, then we remove the even numbers: {3, 6}.\n4. If a set contains two common divisors, then we remove one of them. For example, if set {2, 3} contains two integers, then we remove one of them, 2, and get {3}: {3}.\n5. We repeat steps 2-4 on set {2}: {3}.\n6. Finally, if the set remains after step 5, it is a set of common divisors.\n\nApplying these steps to our original sets, we get:\n\n(A) is aumn't a valid set of common divisors - it contains negative values. So we remove them from the start. Then it contains both odd and even numbers, so we remove the even ones. Finally, it contains two numbers which are common divisors, so we remove one of them. This leaves {3}: {3} - which is clearly not a set of common divisors.\n\n(B) is also not a valid set of common divisors - it contains negative values as well. Again, we remove them at the start. Then it contains both even and odd numbers, so again we remove the even ones. Finally, it contains two numbers which are common divisors, so again we remove one of them. This time, we remove the larger number, 6, to get {2}: {2}. But as we saw with set (A), if a set contains both even and odd numbers, we cannot remove any of them. So again this set is not valid.\n\n(C) contains both even and odd numbers, so we remove the even ones, as we did for set (B). This leaves {3, 2}: {3, 2}. Then we apply step 4: we remove one of the common divisors, 3, to get {2}. This is the correct result, so (C) is the valid solution.\n\n(D) initially includes both even and odd numbers. So we remove the even ones, leaving {2, 3, 6}. Then we apply step 4: we remove one of the common divisors, 2, to get {3, 6}. Finally, we apply step 5: we remove the second common divisor, 3, to get the correct result: {6}.\n\nOverall, the answer is (C).",

No selfloops: This means that each node can only be connected to a maximum of one other node.\n2. At most one edge between any pair of nodes: This means that there can be no more than one edge between any two nodes.\n\nTo determine the possible connected components, we can use the handshake lemma, which states that if there are n nodes in a graph with at most one edge between any two nodes, then there must be at least n-2 connected components.\n\nWe know that there are 10 nodes in each graph in the collection, and there are a maximum of 6 edges between any two nodes. Using the handshake lemma, we can deduce that there must be at least 10-2 = 8 connected components in any graph in the collection.\n\nHowever, if we consider the minimal possible number of connected components, we see that there is a graph with only one connected component.
