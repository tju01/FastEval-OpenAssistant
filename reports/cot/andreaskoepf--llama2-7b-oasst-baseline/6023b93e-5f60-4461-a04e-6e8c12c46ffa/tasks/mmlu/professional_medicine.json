            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation is compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. This nerve runs down the lateral aspect of the thigh and is responsible for sensation to the skin on that side of the leg. Compression of the nerve can cause numbness, tingling, and decreased sensation.\n\nOther causes, such as cerebral infarction, complications of the IVC filter placement, or hematoma of the left thigh, are less likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms. A cerebral infarction would likely cause symptoms such as weakness, loss of consciousness, or altered mental status, rather than a decreased sensation to light touch. Complications of the IVC filter placement would likely cause symptoms related to the abdomen or pelvis, not the thigh. A hematoma of the left thigh would typically cause swelling and pain, not a decreased sensation to light touch.",

This difference is statistically significant, indicating that the new drug has a clinical significance in terms of reducing the duration of cold symptoms compared to placebo.\n\nIn statistical terms, p-value less than 0.05 (0.04 in this case) is considered statistically significant, which means that the results have a high probability of being due to random chance or error and not just due to the treatment effect.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while the study shows a positive treatment effect, it does not provide sufficient evidence to conclusively say that the new drug is always effective or that it works better than placebo. Further research and larger studies would be needed to establish this.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate interpretation of the study results is that the findings are clinically and statistically significant, but further research is needed to fully understand the effectiveness of the new drug.",

The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2 months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years. He has been generally healthy. Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3 years. He takes no medications. He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay. Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy.

He is also at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI, which may be a result of poor nutrition or underlying illness. He has a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border, indicating left ventricular hypertrophy due to congestive heart failure. The radiofemoral delay suggests a poor perfusion of the lower extremities, perhaps due to poor systemic circulation. The chest xray revealed mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence, indicating chronic reduced ejection fraction. and further delineating the rather poor overall perfusion.\nThe ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy suggestive of (among other things) hypertension, which in itself is a major cardiovascular risk factor, and ultimately is probably the most important cause of the patients overall poor health.\n\nTherefore, the most likely complication in this patient is systemic hypertension.",

            "model_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for the 65-year-old woman with the described symptoms and imaging findings is Graves' disease. Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes overproduction of the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4), leading to characteristic symptoms of irritability, palpitations, heat intolerance, and weight loss. The neck mass is typically due to a goiter, an enlarged thyroid gland.\n\nWhile other conditions such as defect in T4 biosynthesis, multinodular goiter, and Riedel's thyroiditis can also cause thyroid enlargement and thyroid hormone imbalances, Graves' disease is the most likely given the woman's symptoms and the 131I scan finding of increased uptake in multiple areas, which is consistent with hyperfunctioning thyroid tissue. Riedel's thyroiditis is a rare condition that involves a blocking of the neck lymph nodes by fibrous tissue, leading to swelling of the thyroid gland and typically a goiter, but it is not characterized by increased radioisotope uptake. Multinodular goiter is a benign growth of the thyroid gland that is typically asymptomatic and not associated with autoimmunity. Defect in T4 biosynthesis is a rare genetic disorder that typically presents with hypothyroidism rather than the hyperthyroidism seen in Graves' disease.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "First of all, it is important to note that squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue is a serious condition that requires prompt evaluation and treatment. The primary site of the tumor should be evaluated first for metastasis, since this is the highest risk site for locoregional recurrence.\n\nIn this case, the tumor is on the apex of the tongue, which implies that the lymph nodes in the neck on the same side as the tumor ( Bilateral Neck ) should be examined first. The relevant lymph nodes for evaluation in this case are:\n\n1. Level 2 neck lymph nodes: The level 2 neck lymph nodes include the inferior deep cervical nodes, also known as the jugulo-omohyoid nodes. They are located in the posterior triangle of the neck, near the jugular vein and the omohyoid muscle. These nodes are the first to receive lymphatic drainage from the base of the tongue, and they are therefore the most likely to have metastasis from a squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue.\n\n2. Retropharyngeal lymph nodes: The retropharyngeal lymph nodes are located posterior to the pharynx and are drained by the retropharyngeal lymph vessels. They are located in the styloid process, the posterior part of the mandible, and the pterygomandibular raphe. These nodes are also at risk for metastasis from squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, particularly if the tumor involves the base of the tongue.\n\n3. Submental lymph nodes: The submental lymph nodes are located under the chin and are drained by the submandibular lymph vessels. These nodes are a less frequent site of metastasis from squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, but they should still be evaluated as part of the workup.\n\n4. Parotid lymph nodes: The parotid lymph nodes are located in the parotid gland and are drained by the Stensen's duct. They are not a major site of metastasis from squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, and their evaluation should be more limited in this case.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate step for evaluation of the patient is to palpate and/or image the level 2 neck lymph nodes (inferior deep cervical lymph nodes) and the retropharyngeal lymph nodes first for evidence of metastasis. These are the most likely sites for involvement from a squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, and their evaluation should be prioritized.",
