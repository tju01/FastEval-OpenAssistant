            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "In a Robertsonian translocation, fusion occurs between the long arms of homologous chromosomes. Since the centromeres are situated in the middle of the chromosomes, fusion cannot occur at the centromere.\n\nThe telomeres are DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes that shorten every time a cell division occurs. Fusion cannot occur at telomeres because they do not play a role in chromosome segregation during cell division.\n\nThe histones are DNA-binding proteins that package DNA into nucleosomes and regulate its accessibility. Fusion cannot occur at histones because it involves a rearrangement of the chromosome structure, which would require the disassembly and reassembly of the nucleosomes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: (B) centromeres.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Let's break down the question into smaller steps so we can solve it step-by-step.\n\n1. Identify what the question is asking. The question is asking about the relationship between Zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins.\n\n2. Define the terms. Zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins are types of DNA-binding proteins. Each of these proteins has a specific function that relates to DNA binding.\n\n3. Determine the possible answers. The possible answers are (A), (B), (C), or (D). We want to eliminate any answers that don't relate to DNA binding.\n\n4. Evaluate the answers. Here's our evaluation:\n\n- Type of DNA-binding protein: Answer (A) is correct. Zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins are both types of DNA-binding proteins.\n- Involved in the control of translation: Answer (B) is incorrect. While Zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins may play a role in translation, they are not primarily involved in the control of translation.\n- Components of ribosomes: Answer (C) is incorrect. Zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins do not directly affect ribosomes.\n- Part of the hemoglobin in blood cells: Answer (D) is incorrect. While hemoglobin is certainly a protein, it plays no direct role in DNA binding.",

Since this is a recessive condition, if a woman gets this condition she will have two X-chromosomes, one of which has the mutation. This means that only one of her two X-chromosomes needs to have the mutation in order to get the condition, so she will be affected.\n\n3. If one in ten males are affected then that means that .1 of the females in the population have an affected father (one in ten). This means that .9 of the females in the population have unaffected fathers (nine in ten).\n\n4. We know the frequency of affected females is .9 because all of their fathers are unaffected.\n\n5. Therefore, the expected frequency of affected females is .9. (answer: D)",

It is characterized by an rapid increase in body temperature, tachycardia (fast heart rate), tachypnea (fast breathing), muscle rigidity, and even death in severe cases.\n\nNow, we need to consider the inheritance pattern of MH. According to medical literature, MH is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder. This means that only a single copy of the mutated gene is needed to cause the disease, and a person with one copy of the mutated gene is said to be a carrier. Affected individuals have a 50% chance of passing on the mutated gene to their offspring.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (A) autosomal dominant.",

Amino acids in a protein are generally numbered sequentially starting from the N-terminus (the amino group attached to the nitrogen atom in the first residue). Therefore, Asp235 is the 235th residue from the N-terminus, which is equivalent to position 235 in the protein structure.\n\n3.
