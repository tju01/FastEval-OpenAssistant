            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I can help you with this question. Here's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. We need to calculate the expected revenue per day. The expected revenue per day is $245 * 0.8 = $192.\n\n2. Since we are planning to work all year round, we can calculate the expected revenue per year as follows:\n\n   Expected revenue per year = Expected revenue per day * Number of working days per year\n\n   Expected revenue per year = $192 * 365 = $67,680\n\n3. We also need to calculate the expected daily costs. The expected daily costs are $50 + $98,000 = $103,000.\n\n4. So the expected yearly yield on our investment is:\n\n   Expected yearly yield on investment = Revenue - Daily costs\n\n   Expected yearly yield on investment = $67,680 - $103,000\n\n   Expected yearly yield on investment = -$35,320\n\n5. As a result, the expected yearly yield on our investment is -35,320%.\n\nThe answer is therefore option (D).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Sure! Here's my explanation step-by-step:\n\nCorrect answer (D): Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.\n\nSampling risk is the uncertainty associated with selecting a sample from a population and using the sample results to draw conclusions about the entire population. When a nonissuer's auditor uses sampling techniques, there is a risk that the auditor might select audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective of the audit. For example, if the objective is to determine whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements, the auditor might select audit procedures that are not appropriate for detecting a particular type of misstatement.\n\nNonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population. This risk occurs because of the possibility of error in the selection or performance of the sample, or because the sample does not represent the population accurately. For example, if the auditor selects a sample of 20 items from a population of 100, and only one of the 20 items is misstated, the auditor may mistakenly conclude that the financial statements are free from material misstatements.\n\nNonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements. This risk occurs because the auditor might fail to identify a misstatement during the audit, even though it exists in the population. For example, if the auditor does not test a certain account that is susceptible to material misstatement, the auditor may fail to identify a misstatement in that account.\n\nSampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks. This risk occurs because of the inherent uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks. For example, if the auditor selects a sample of 20 items from a population of 100, and only one of the 20 items is misstated, the auditor may mistakenly conclude that the financial statements are free from material misstatements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D), Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Option C, \"Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end\", is the correct response.\n\nWhen an auditor is performing a financial statement audit, subsequent events are events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the auditor submits the financial statements to the client. Auditors are responsible for evaluating the impact of subsequent events on the financial statements and determining if they need to be disclosed in the financial statements.\n\nReviewing the client's cutoff bank statements after the year end is one way an auditor can identify subsequent events that may have a material impact on the financial statements. For example, if there are any unrecorded transactions on the client's books or bank statements that affect the balances at the end of the year, the auditor would need to adjust the financial statements to reflect the correct balance. This process helps ensure that the financial statements accurately reflect the client's financial position at the end of the year.",
