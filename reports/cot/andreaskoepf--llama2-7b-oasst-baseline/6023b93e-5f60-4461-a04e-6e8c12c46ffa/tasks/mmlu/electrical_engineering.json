            "model_answer": "In order to determine the correct statement, we can use a block diagram of an ideal classical phase-locked loop (PLL) with its main components:\n\n- The VCO generates a sine wave at the output with frequency `f_0`.\n- The band-pass filter samples the frequency `f_0` and filters it to frequency `f_b`.\n- The integrator accepts the output of the filter at `f_b` as input and generates the negative of its integral.\n- The differential amplifier inputs the negative of the integral of `f_b` and compares it to the reference signal `f_ref`, normally set to `f_0`, at the selector.\n- The selector switches between the output of the diff-amp and the reference signal according to the present state of the corresponding gate.\n- The divider divides the output of the selector by `N`, where typically `N >= 2`.\n- The feedback delay makes sure the pseudo-random series of voltage levels at the input of the selector wait for the same duration as that of the output at the output of the selector.\n\nWe can use the Barkhausen criterion and apply it to the differential amplifier to see what the loop gain should be. \n\nThe Barkhausen criterion states that the amplifier input should be less than the output at all times in steady state.\n\n`V_in < V_out`\n\nThe input and output of the differential amplifier are in the form of series of voltage levels with durations much greater than the time constant of the loop, so we can use the voltage levels at the terminals of the amplifier to represent the input and output without loss of generality. \n\nThe amplifier takes a voltage level `V_in` at the terminals and produces an output `V_out` with delay of `T_{delay} = 1/C$, where `C` is the capacitor connected to the output. \n\nWe must check the expressions for `V_in` and `V_out` to ensure that it is less than 1 for a sufficiently large system time period containing at least `T_{delay} = 1/C$ time periods:\n\n```math\nV_{out} = 1 - e^{-\\beta (t-T_{delay})} > 1\nV_{in} = 1 + e^{-\\beta (t-T_{delay})} <= 1\n``` \n\nThis means that if `beta` is greater than `1/T_{delay} = 1/C`, then the amplifier input will cross the output after at least one time period. \n\nIf the amplifier input cannot cross the amplifier output then the loop gain would be infinity as no signal could filter out of the feedback loop. \n\nHere, `beta` is `f_b/f_0`, so to calculate the loop gain we need to find out the frequencies `f_b` and `f_0`.\n\n`f_b` is set by the band-pass filter, typically to highlight just the carrier frequency. \n\n`f_0` is set by the VCO, typically to `f_0 = 1/T_{delay}`. \n\nSo `beta` is `f_b/f_0 = f_b/1/T_{delay} = 1/T_{delay}`. \n\nThe loop gain should satisfy `1/T_{delay} < 1`, so the loop gain should be less than unity, `g = 1/T_{delay} < 1`.",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Define key terms\n1. Single-phase: The circuit will have only a single phase, with no splitting of the voltage into three separate phases.\n2. One-pulse controlled: The circuit will experience a single pulse of voltage, rather than a sustained waveform.\n3. Resistance: The amount of opposition to the flow of electric current in a circuit.\n4. Counter emf E: The emf generated by the source voltage in the circuit.\n5. Firing angle: The angle between the voltage source and the current flow in the circuit.\n\nStep 2: Identify the given information\n1. The circuit has a resistance R and a counter emf E of 400 sin(314 t).\n2. The load counter emf is 200 V.\n\nStep 3: Determine the output voltage\n1. Since the circuit is one-pulse controlled, the output voltage will only exist for a single pulse. Once the pulse ends, the output voltage will return to zero.\n2. To determine the output voltage during the pulse, we can use the voltage divider rule, which states that the output voltage is equal to the ratio of the resistances times the input voltage.\n3. Since we have a resistance R and a counter emf E, we can set up the following voltage divider:\n  V = E / (R + R)\n\nStep 4: Solve for the output voltage\n1. We know that the input voltage is E = 400 sin(314 t) and the load counter emf is E = 200 V.\n2. We also know that R is the resistance of the circuit.\n3. Plugging in the given values, we get:\n  V = E / (R + R)\n  V = 400 sin(314 t) / (R + R)\n  V = 400 sin(314 t) / 2R\n\nStep 5: Calculate the firing angle\n1. We can use these calculations to find the firing angle:\n  E = 400 sin(314 t)\n  V = 400 sin(314 t) / 2R\n  V / 2R = sin(314 t)\n  t = 314\u00b0/sin(314\u00b0)\n  t \u2248 0.0023 \u00b0\n\n2. Since the pulses in a one-pulse controlled circuit are very short, we can assume that the pulse happens exactly at the firing angle.\n3. Therefore, the firing angle is 0.0023 \u00b0.\n\nStep 6: Determine the range of firing angle control\n1. Based on our calculations, the firing angle is 0.0023 \u00b0.\n2. To determine the range of firing angle control, we first need to define the limits of the angle:\n  Angle 0: The firing angle at which the output voltage is zero. This will be the highest possible angular value that the circuit can operate at.\n  Angle 360: The firing angle at which the output voltage is equal to the load counter emf. This will be the lowest possible angular value that the circuit can operate at.\n3. Subtracting angle 0 from angle 360, we get the range of firing angle control:\n  Angle 360\u00b0 - Angle 0\u00b0 = 360\u00b0 - 0\u00b0 = 360\u00b0\n\nStep 7: Calculate the range of firing angle control\n1. Based on our calculations, the firing angle is 0.0023 \u00b0.\n2. Therefore, the range of firing angle control is 360\u00b0 - 0.0023 \u00b0 = 359.977 \u00b0.\n\nStep 8: Conclude the answer\n1. Based on our calculations, the answer is (C) 60\u00b0 to 120\u00b0.\n2. The firing angle is between 60\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, since this is within the range of 359.977 \u00b0 given that 0.0023 \u00b0 is essentially zero.\n3. Therefore, the answer is (C) 60\u00b0 to 120\u00b0.",

However, this voltage range is not typically used for directional heating due to its limitations in terms of temperature and precision.\n\n15 kV: This is a mid-range voltage commonly used for directional heating of materials such as wire in industrial applications. At this voltage, it is possible to achieve high temperatures and reasonable degrees of precision.\n\n33 kV: This is a higher voltage range commonly used for directional heating of materials such as wire in power transmission applications.
