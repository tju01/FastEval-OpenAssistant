            "correct_answer": "(B)",
            "model_answer": "The statement \"That's only about $10 per mile for a van, perfectly reasonable fuel costs\" is sarcastic. Sarcasm is a form of expression that involves a playful or mocking use of language. People often use sarcasm to convey a meaning that is opposite to the literal meaning of their words.\n\nHere are the steps I took to identify this statement as sarcastic:\n\n1. Context: I took into account the context of the statements. The context suggests that the statement about fuel costs is in response to a discussion about van fuel costs.\n\n2. Inconsistent Positive Language: The statement uses consistently positive language to describe the fuel costs as \"perfectly reasonable.\" However, the statement itself implies that these costs are unreasonable.\n\n3. Contrasting Language: The statement contrasts the described fuel costs with other costs. This juxtaposition creates a semblance of reasonableness, while the actual intention is to highlight the unreasonableness of the costs.\n\n4. Tone: The tone of the statement is playful and mocking, indicating a sense of irony or sarcasm.\n\nOverall, the statement's inconsistent positive language, contrasting language, and tone indicate sarcasm.",
