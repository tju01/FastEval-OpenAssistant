It may be helpful to write them down or create a table to keep track of the options.\n\n2. Determine the color of the object directly to the left of the cup: Among the objects on the desk, there is a cup. The object directly to the left of the cup must be the mug, since mugs traditionally come in pairs on either side of the cup. So the mug is purple.\n\n3. Determine the color of the object directly to the right of the mug: The object directly to the right of the mug must be the teddy bear, since it is not in the row with the cup and mug. So the teddy bear is blue.\n\n4. Compute the left most object minus 1: Since the cup is the first object in the list, it is labeled with 0. The left most object is the mug, which is labeled with 1. The left most object minus 1 is 0 - 1 = -1.\n\n5. Determine the color of the object with the negative left most object: The negative left most object is blue, which was determined in step 3. So the object with the negative left most object is the cup.\n\n6. The answer is the color of the object with the negative left most object: The answer is going to be the color of the cup.

We want to find out how many scrunchiephone chargers remain on the table if we remove all the black items from the table.\n3. To do this, we need to keep track of how many scrunchiephone chargers we have removed. Let's do this by performing the following steps:\n4. We start with 6 scrunchiephone chargers remaining (3 pink and 3 orange)\n5. We remove the first black scrunchiephone charger, which is the leftmost one. Therefore, we have removed 1 scrunchiephone charger.\n6. We now have 5 scrunchiephone chargers remaining (3 pink and 2 orange)\n7. We remove the second black scrunchiephone charger, which is the rightmost one. Therefore, we have removed 1 scrunchiephone charger.\n8. We now have 4 scrunchiephone chargers remaining (3 pink and 1 orange)\n\nThis means that after removing all the black items from the table, we have 4 scrunchiephone chargers remaining.\n\nHence, the answer is (D) 4.",
