Shape: square, rectangular, triangular, oval, round, elliptical, heart-shaped\n4. Color: purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, red, black, white, ivory, gray, pink, rainbow (this one is also somewhat optional, but common)\n5. Material: cotton, silk, wool, leather, plastic, nylon, polyester, natural fiber\n6. Origin: American, Canadian, British, Irish, Australian, Welsh, Scottish, Ethiopian, Japanese, Bolivian, etc.\n7. Quality: high-quality, low-quality, premium, economy, budget, deluxe, standard, moderate\n8. Manufacturer: Nike, Adidas, Reebok, Under Armour, New Balance, Asics, Columbia, Patagonia, North Face\n9. Special features: washable, dry clean only, handmade, machine-made, with tags, without tags, vintage, authentic, replica, etc.\n10.

Articles (a, an, the)\n\nThe order is incorrect because \"drinking\" should come after \"German\".\n\nIn the sentence (B), the adjective order is:\n\n1. Quantitative (drinking)\n2.

            "question": "Which sentence has the correct adjective order:\nOptions:\n(A) square Congolese driving old-fashioned dog\n(B) old-fashioned square Congolese driving dog",
            "correct_answer": "(B)",
            "model_answer": "The sentence with the correct adjective order is Option (B): \"old-fashioned square Congolese driving dog\".\n\nHere is my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. When adjectives modify nouns, they follow a specific order in English:\n\n* **Opinion adjectives**: tall, beautiful, happy\n* **Size adjectives**: large, small, big\n* **Age adjectives**: old, young\n* **Shape adjectives**: square, round, rectangular\n* **Nationality adjectives**: Congolese, American, British\n* **Possession adjectives**: old-fashioned, new, used\n\n2. In the given options, only Option (B) follows this order. Option (A) has the opinion adjective \"square\" before the nationality adjective \"Congolese\", which is incorrect. Option (C) has the possession adjective \"old-fashioned\" before the shape adjective \"square\", which is also incorrect. Only Option (B) correctly follows this order.\n\n3. Therefore, the sentence with the correct adjective order is Option (B): \"old-fashioned square Congolese driving dog\".",
