            "model_answer": "We can reason through the times that Susan could have gone to the coffee shop based on the information given in the question:\n\nFirst, we need to determine when Susan woke up. Since Linda saw Susan driving to the water park from 7am to 11am, we know that she woke up before 11am.\n\nNext, we need to determine when Susan bought clothes at the mall. Since John saw Susan buying clothes at the mall from 11am to 12pm, we know that she bought clothes between 11am and 12pm.\n\nSimilarly, we can determine when Susan took photos near the Eiffel Tower, bought lunch at the deli, and read at the library.\n\nBased on this information, we can rule out the options (A) 6pm to 9pm and (D) 2pm to 6pm, since the coffee shop was closed after 9pm.\n\nNow, let's look at the options (B) 7am to 11am and (C) 1pm to 2pm. Susan could have gone to the coffee shop between 7am and 11am or between 1pm and 2pm. However, since Linda, John, Jessica, and Steven all saw Susan at different locations at different times, it's more likely that she went to the coffee shop between the times they saw her. For example, if she had gone to the coffee shop after leaving the water park, Linda would have seen her driving back home instead. Similarly, if she had gone to the coffee shop after buying clothes, John would have seen her in a different location.\n\nTherefore, the only option that remains is (C) 1pm to 2pm. Susan could have gone to the coffee shop between 1pm and 2pm.",

Since Leslie saw Leslie buying cookies, Leslie cannot have gone to the orchestra hall before 8AM.\nFinally, since the orchestra hall was closed after 8PM, Leslie cannot have gone to the orchestra hall after 8PM.

            "model_answer": "We can eliminate some options right off the bat, since Ashley saw Hannah getting a coffee at the cafe from 9am to 7pm, that means that the photo taking could not have taken place before she got the coffee. Additionally, Hannah could not have been at the beach between 5am to 7am, as Richard saw her outdoors sitting on a rooftop at 5am, before she had gotten a coffee.\n\nTherefore, the options are: \n(A) 7pm to 8pm, \n(B) 7am to 9am",
