Note that the cardinal is second from the right, not fourth from the left. That is, looking at the seven objects, the robin is the one that is the first in its group of three to the left, and the second in its group of three to the right.

That is, the owl is in the group of three objects to the left of \"robin\", and is the second in that group, so it is the second object.\n\nThe third object is the \"quail\", which is neighbored to the left by the \"falcon\", to its left by the \"hummingbird\", to the right of the \"cardinal\", thrid from the right, and second from the right.

Since there are only 7 objects, we can start counting from the right and go left, ending at the first object.\n\n``` rust\n     r        q        b        c        r        h        a\n```\n\nAssuming the hummingbird is the third from the right:\n\n``` rust\n     r        q        b        c        r             h        a\n```\n\nSince we know the position of the hummingbird, we can figure out the position of the other objects. For example:\n\n``` rust\n     r        q        b        c        r        h        a\n```\n\nBecause the raven is to the left of the robin, we know that it is to the left of the hummingbird and thus we know the position of the raven:\n\n``` rust\n     r        q        b        c        r        h        a\n```\n\nWe then know the position of the cardinal, because it is to the left of the hummingbird:\n\n``` rust\n     r        q        b        c        r        h        a\n```\n\nNow we can see that the quail is between the cardinal and the robin, and therefore the quail is to the right of the crow:\n\n``` rust\n     r        q        b        c        r        h        a\n```\n\nBecause the blue jay is the third from the right, that means it is to the left of the hummingbird, but also to the right of the cardinal, since it can't be to the left of both the cardinal and the hummingbird:\n\n``` rust\n     r        q        b        c        r        h        a\n```\n\nFinally, we can see that the cardinal is to the left of the robin, so the cardinal must be the third from the right:\n\n``` rust\n     r        q        b        c        r        h        a\n```\n\nSince the cardinal is the third from the right, the answer must be (G) \"The cardinal is the third from the right.\"",

It does not say anything about their price compared to the other objects. Therefore, we can rule out this option.\n\n```\n(B) The kiwis are the most expensive\n```\n\nReasoning:\nThe paragraph mentions that the kiwis are less expensive than the loquats and that the loquats are third-cheapest. We can infer that the kiwis must be more expensive than the third-cheapest object, which is the loquats. We can also deduce from this that the kiwis must be more expensive than the fourth-cheapest object, which is the watermelons. Therefore, the kiwis must be more expensive than the watermelons. While the paragraph does not directly say that the kiwis are most expensive, we can logically deduce this from the available information.\n\n```\n(C) The cantaloupes are the most expensive\n```\n\nReasoning:\nThe paragraph mentions that the cantaloupes are the most expensive. This statement is consistent within the paragraph, so the cantaloupes must be the most expensive.\n\n```\n(D) The pears are the most expensive\n```\n\nReasoning:\nThe pears are mentioned as being less expensive than the apples. However, the paragraph does not specifically name any other object as more expensive than the pears, so we cannot rule them out.\n\n```\n(E) The watermelons are the most expensive\n```\n\nReasoning:\nThe watermelons are mentioned as being second-most expensive. They must be more expensive than all other objects, except for the cantaloupes. This means that the watermelons must be the most expensive.\n\n```\n(F) The apples are the most expensive\n```\n\nReasoning:\nThe apples are mentioned as being less expensive than the loquats.

I know that these objects are arranged in a fixed order because of the statements \"The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph\".\n2. The second line tells me that there are seven birds:\n3. The third line tells me that the falcon is the second from the left.\n4. The fourth line tells me that the crow is the rightmost.\n5. The fifth line tells me that the hummingbird is to the right of the blue jay.\n6. The sixth line tells me that the hawk is to the right of the hummingbird.\n7. The Seventh line tells me that the blue jay is to the right of the owl.\n8. The eighth line tells me that the raven is to the left of the falcon.\n\n    I can conclude based on the information that we have:\n    There are seven objects.\n    The objects are a raven and a falcon, then a hawk, then a hummingbird, then a blue jay and an owl.\n9. The rule for deciding which one of the options is the correct one based on the arrangement of these objects could be:\n- The first letter of the option tells me which object is on the left.\n- The second letter of the option tells me which object is in the middle.\n- The third letter of the option tells me which object is on the right.\n\nIn this case that would be:\n- \"A\" the blue jay would be on the left.\n- \"B\" the owl would be in the middle.\n- \"C\" the falcon would be on the right.\n- \"D\" the hawk would be on the right.\n- \"E\" the raven would be on the left.\n- \"F\" the crow would be in the middle.\n- \"G\" the hummingbird would be on the right.\n\n\nWhile it seems that \"D\" and \"G\" match the objects on the right and on the left, only one of them is correct. If we scramble the description of the objects and apply the same rules we found, we get:\n- There are seven objects.\n- The objects are a crow, then a hummingbird, then a hawk, then a falcon, then a blue jay and an owl.\n- If we take away the first letter from each option we get:\n  - \"dG\" (matches the objects on the right and left)\n  - \"cF\" (matches the objects on the right and left, but the order is different)\n- According to our rule for choosing the correct option, \"D\" is the correct answer.",

Since it is sandwiched between two other books, it must be to the left of one book and to the right of another book.\n4. The book to the left of the brown book must be the leftmost book, and hence is the gray book.\n5.
