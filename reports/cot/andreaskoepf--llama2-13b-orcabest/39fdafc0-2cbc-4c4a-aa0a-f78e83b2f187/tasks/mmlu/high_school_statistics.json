An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim.

Find the standard deviation of the sample weights.\n3. Obtain the sample variance.\n4. Calculate the test statistic using the weighted average of the sample weights, adjusted for the mean, and compare it to the given critical value from the t-distribution.\n5. Extract the P-value based on the calculatedtest statistic and degrees of freedom.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the mean and standard deviation of the sample weights:\nMean(w) = (w1 + w2 + w3 + ... + wn) / n = (299 + 300 + 305 + 302 + 299 + 301 + 303) / 7 = 300\n\nThe average is 300, so it's consistent with the manufacturer's claim.\n\nStandard Deviation(sd) = (s^2)^(1/2) = ((w1 - 300)^2 + (w2 - 300)^2 + ... + (wn - 300)^2) / n = ((299 - 300)^2 + (300 - 300)^2 + ... + (303 - 300)^2) / 7 = 1.00 (which is equal to the sum of the absolute differences of each weight from 300, divided by the number of observations in the sample)\n\nWe can notice that only one of the sample weights is lower than 300, so the standard deviation is not zero as we assume that each weight is approximately the same. Now let's obtain the test statistic:\nT = (300 - 300) / sd = (0) / (1) = 0\n\nThe test statistic T = 0, which means the sample weight is exactly the same as the given measurement and is not providing any evidence against the manufacturer's claim. Now, let's calculate the P-value:\n\nP-value = P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n\nThis can be calculated from the standard normal distribution, since the test statistic is close to 0:\nP(t > 1.54) = 1 - P(t \u2264 1.54) = 1 - 0.9745 (solving the normal distribution for t with critical value 1.54 and degrees of freedom 6)\nP-value = 0.0255\n\nSo, the P-value of the hypothesis test is 0.0255.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n(A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6",

However, some discrete random variables can be numerical or even real-valued if the probability distribution is continuous (e.g. normal distribution). So, this statement isn't always true.\n\n(B) The possible outcomes must be mutually exclusive.\nIn general, this statement is not true. It is possible for an outcome to be conditional on another outcome, which violates the mutually exclusive property. For example, if two dice are thrown, the outcome (sum) can't be both 2 and 9 because they are not mutually exclusive.

The evidence needed for both levels is independent.\n\n(B) Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered.\nThis statement is correct because the choice between a one-sided or a two-sided test depends on the type of hypothesis being tested and the stated direction of effect. Typically, this decision is made after data collection.\n\n(C) If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.\nThis statement is not entirely correct because it assumes that the studied difference between the null and alternative hypothesis is zero. In fact, when conducting a hypothesis test, it's generally true that the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis is a function of the effect size rather than a constant 1%.\n\n(D) The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.\nThis statement is correct because the power of a test refers to the probability of correctly rejecting a null hypothesis when an alternative hypothesis is true.

            "model_answer": "In order to answer this question, let us first understand the concepts involved:\n\n1. Significance level: It is the level of risk we can tolerate, or the likelihood of concluding that the null hypothesis is true when it is actually false, which is denoted as alpha (\u03b1). In this case, the significance level is 0.05.\n\n2. Null hypothesis: It is a tentative statement or assumption we want to test in an experiment, and it is generally assumed to be true. In this question, the null hypothesis is false.\n\n3. Experimental units: These are the entities or subjects on which the experiment is conducted.\n\n4. Treatments: These are conditions or manipulable aspects of the experiment designed to test the null hypothesis.\n\n5. Probability of a Type I error (alpha error) and probability of a Type II error: These are the probabilities of accepting the null hypothesis when it is false and rejecting it when it is true, respectively.\n\n6. Power: The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is, in fact, false.\n\nNow let us analyze the options:\n\n(A) If we double the number of experimental units for each treatment, it might result in increased statistical power, i.e. increased probability of detecting a significant effect even if there is a small population effect. It does not directly affect the probability of Type I and Type II errors, as these errors depend on our decision-making criteria (above vs. below the significance level).\n\n(B) Doubling the number of experimental units would increase the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false, therefore increasing the power. However, since we're already below the significance level (0.05), the probability of committing a Type I error would not decrease.\n\n(C) Doubling the number of experimental units would increase the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false and thus increase the power, but this does not affect the probability of a Type II error since the null hypothesis is assumed to be false.\n\n(D) This option is half-correct and half-incorrect. Doubling the number of experimental units would indeed increase the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false, which increases the power. However, the probability of committing a Type I error would change, but not necessarily stay the same. Since the new null hypothesis is false, the modified experiment will produce a smaller probability of Type I errors at the same level of significance.

A smaller standard deviation means that the heights of the members in the population are relatively closer to the mean, whereas a larger standard deviation means that heights are more spread out.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. Adult men mean height: 70 inches\n2. Standard deviation for men: 4 inches\n3. Adult women mean height: 66 inches\n4. Standard deviation for women: 3 inches\n5. Height of the man: 74 inches\n6. Height of the woman: 70 inches\n\nTo determine who is more unusually tall, we need to understand how far their heights are from the mean height within their respective sex:\n\n1. For the man:\n   - From his mean (70 inches) + 4 inches standard deviation = 74 inches\n2. For the woman:\n   - From her mean (66 inches) + 3 inches standard deviation = 69 inches\n\nThe man's height is 3 inches more than the mean height of adult men plus 4 inches standard deviation, which equals 74 inches. The woman's height is 5 inches less than her mean height of 66 inches plus 3 inches standard deviation, which equals 71 inches.

In this case, the man is 1 standard deviation above the mean height of adult men, while the woman's height is 1.33 standard deviations above the mean height of all women (because she is 1 standard deviation above, and 1/3 of another standard deviation).\n\nBased on this differentiation, the answer is:\n\n(D) The woman, because her height is 1.33 standard deviations above the mean height of all women, whereas the man\u2019s height is only one standard deviation above the mean height of all men.",

T-distributions are based on the t-distribution formula, which depends on the degrees of freedom (df). When the sample size or number of degrees of freedom increases, the t-distribution becomes more peaked, resembling the standard normal distribution. For small samples, the t-distribution is more spread out.\n\n(B) t-distributions are bell-shaped and symmetric.\n\nExplanation: This is more applicable to normal distributions rather than t-distributions. t-distributions have fatter tails than the normal distribution, which means that they are more spread out than the normal distribution. This makes t-distributions leptokurtic and not strictly bell-shaped or necessarily symmetric.\n\n(C) t-distributions always have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n\nExplanation: False. While the mean of a t-distribution can be 0 for some cases (e.g., the one-sample t-test), the standard deviation of a t-distribution is not always 1. The standard deviation depends on the degrees of freedom (df) and the location and scale parameters of the distribution. For small values of the statistic being tested, the t-distribution becomes more peaked, resulting in a standard deviation closer to 1. For larger values, the standard deviation becomes greater than 1.\n\n(D) t-distributions are more spread out than the normal distribution.\n\nExplanation: True. t-distributions are more spread out due to their fatter tails, which corresponds to a higher level of variability compared to the normal distribution.\n\nFrom the given options, the statement that is not true about t-distributions is:\n\n(B) t-distributions are bell-shaped and symmetric.",

This implies an experiment where the subjects are exposed to alcohol, not merely an observational study.\n\n(B) Lack of blocking makes this a poorly designed study.\nExplanation: Blocking is a experimental design technique that ensures equal distribution of the effect being studied in the experimental and control groups.
