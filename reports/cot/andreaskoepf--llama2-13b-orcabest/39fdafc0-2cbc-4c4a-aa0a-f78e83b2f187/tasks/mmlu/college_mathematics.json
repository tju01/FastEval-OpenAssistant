But this functions applies to all elements of the group. That means all elements of the group are additive inverses of each other, and all elements in the group sum up to 0.\n\nThis happens when the group has an identity element. An identity element is an element which, when added to any element, results in that element. Here, we need such an element 'e' that when any other element 'x' is added to 'e', it still results in the zero element, i.e., 'e' + 'x' = 0.\n\nFor the group G of order 16, an additive identity element 'e' exists if and only if gcd(16, 16) = 1 or 16. \n\nHowever, for any prime factor p and any positive number q, we know that gcd(p^q,p^q) = p^q - p^(q-1). In our case, since all 16 gives rise to 0, therefore, p^q - p^(q-1) = 0.\n\nSince p^1-p^0 = p-1 = 1 because p is prime and greater than 1, we have 16 = 16. This contradicts with our assumption above. \n\nTherefore, our assumption about having an identity element is false and G doesn't have an 'e' with the property 'e' + 'x' = 0. \n\nSo, G doesn't satisfy the given property by assumption.

Since the degree of the polynomial over Z_5 is less than or equal to 7, the result will be a polynomial also modulo an equivalent modulo function.\n\n1. Advantage: We have a very wide range of coefficients (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4).\n2. Advantage: Modulo 5, (x^6) mod 5 = (x^7) mod 5. Hence, higher degree polynomials essentially become lower degree polynomials in this case.\n3. Disadvantage: 0 is the only constant, so we can only represent a constant 0.\n\nNow let's use the operator D to determine the null space n and the range r of D.\n\n1. For any polynomial p(x), its derivative can take the following forms: x, 2x, 3x, 4x, or 5x mod 5. These forms are a complete set of basis modulo 5.\n2. For the bound rabbit: if the degree bound is less than or equal to 7, then the derivative can only be of degree 6 at most. Since 6 divide by 5 leaves a remainder of 1, the derivative polygonios probably can't be 0 mod 5. Hence, we can deduce that the null space is bigger than 0.\n\nSo, we hypothesize that the degree 6 derivative polynomials will fall in the range, and since we have 6 possible values for derivative - D(C_0), D(C_1), D(C_2), D(C_3), D(C_4), D(C_5), the polynomial degree bound must shift up by one (or 0 modulo 5). This means the dimension of the space containing the constant polynomial (C_0) and its derivatives is exactly 1.\n\nTherefore, the operator D will have:\n- Null Space: n = 1 (since it doesn't have any effect on 'C_0', and only affects the rest via modulo operation)\n- Range: r = 6 (since there are 6 possible distinct constant functions)\n\nThis leads to the answer:\n\n(A) n = 1 and r = 6",
