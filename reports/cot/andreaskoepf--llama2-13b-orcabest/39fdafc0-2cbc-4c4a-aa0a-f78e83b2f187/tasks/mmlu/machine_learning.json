It has lower variance than any other unbiased estimator.\n\nStatement 2: \"The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\"\n\nAdaBoost is a algorithms that boosts weak learners and produces a strong classifier. While it does not force the coefficients to be non-negative, the boosting process tends to produce coefficients that are non-negative. In most cases, it can be assumed that the coefficients are non-negative.\n\nTaking both statements into account, we can say that statement 1 is true and statement 2 is either true or practically true.

The first attribute has 3 possible values. In order to find the maximum number of combinations for the first attribute, we consider all possible values for the rest of the attributes. For example, if we take attribute 1 to have a 3-value set A, attribute 2 takes 2 value set B, attribute 3 takes 2 value set C, and attribute 4 takes the remaining. That would give us: 3 (A) x 2 (B) x 2 (C) x 2(D)... which equals 12. \n\nSo, the maximum possible combinations for the first attribute is 12.\n\n2. Repeat this process for the other three attributes. Attribute 2 has 2 possible values, so the maximum number of combinations is again 12.\n\n3. Similarly, Attribute 3 and Attribute 4 have 2 possible values each, resulting in 12 combinations each.\n\n4. Now, we multiply the maximum possible combinations of all four attributes by the number of class values:\n\n12 (first attribute) x 12 (second attribute) x 12 (third attribute) x 12 (fourth attribute) = 1728\n\nHowever, since we multiply the possibilities, we can simplify by dividing by 4 (the number of attributes) to find the maximum possible different examples:\n\n1728 / 4 = 432\n\nSo, the maximum possible different examples for this machine learning problem with 4 attributes, each having 3 values, and a class with 3 possible values, are 48.\n\nThe correct answer is (C) 48.",

They are well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to extract relevant features from images at different resolutions.\n- Graph networks (B) are a type of neural network that uses graph-structure data. They can model relationships between nodes, such as objects, people, or events, making them useful for applications like social network analysis or recommender systems.\n- Fully connected networks (C) have neurons connected directly to every other neuron in their layer, and they are not well-suited for image classification tasks since they lack the ability to process high-resolution images efficiently.\n- RBF networks (D) are based on radial basis functions, and they can approximate any continuous function using a set of basis functions centered at specific points in the input space. They are more suitable for functions or datasets with very high dimensionality.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate their performance on high-resolution images\n- Convolutional networks (A) have outperformed other neural network types in image recognition tasks, including those with high-resolution images. They can be trained with large datasets to provide accurate classification results and can parallelize linearly on large datasets, making them efficient.\n- Both graph networks (B) and RBF networks (D) are not primarily designed for image classification tasks and don't have optimum advantages in this context. Their performance on high-resolution images is lower than that of convolutional networks.\n- Fully connected networks (C), due to being connected directly to every neuron, become less efficient and may struggle to output accurate results with high-resolution images. Their performance is significantly lower than that of other options.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best architecture for classifying high-resolution images as of 2020 is (A) Convolutional networks, as they have proven to be efficient and provide optimal results for image classification tasks.",

The EM algorithm is known to have properties of monotone increase in the log-likelihood function. However, it is not guaranteed that it will always increase in every iteration.

Let's analyze both operations:\n\n1. Subtracting the gradient vector g from the parameters\n   - Since the gradient vector g is of the same length as the parameters, this can be done by multiplying each element of g by a learning rate and subtracting it from the corresponding element of the parameters (weights or biases).\n   - Complexity: Depending on the operation used (e.g., explicit multiplication with a learning rate or its element-wise multiplication with the learning rate), the complexity can be either O(D), if there is only a single multiplication with the learning rate, or O(D*N), if there is an inner loop for each parameter.\n\n2. Updating the parameters with the aim to minimize the loss function.\n   - After the gradient descent update is performed, we have to update our parameters by subtracting the result of the gradient descent update from the current parameters. In other words, similar operations are performed as in the first update step.\n   - Complexity: Again, depending on the operation used, the complexity can be either O(D) or O(D*N). \n\nCombining both operations' complexities, we have two possible cases:\n\n- Case 1: If we use explicit multiplication with the learning rate, the overall complexity would be O(D + D * N) = O(D * N) per gradient descent update.\n- Case 2: If we use element-wise multiplication with the learning rate, the overall complexity would be O(D + D * N) = O(D) per gradient descent update.\n\nSo, given the gradient, the cost of one gradient descent update can be O(D) or O(D * N) depending on the specific implementation.
