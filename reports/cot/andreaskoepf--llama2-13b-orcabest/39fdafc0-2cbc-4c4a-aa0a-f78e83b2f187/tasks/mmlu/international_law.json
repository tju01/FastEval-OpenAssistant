            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to identify which state has jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels. We'll analyze the given options one by one:\n\n(A) The coastal State: This is the state with coastline adjacent to the sea or ocean, and generally, it has some jurisdiction over the waters extending into the sea from its coastline. However, it doesn't necessarily cover crimes committed on board vessels.\n\n(B) The flag State: This is the state of registry of the vessel, and it usually has jurisdiction over the vessel, its crew, and its cargo, while the vessel is within its territorial waters or specific designated waters.\n\n(C) All States enjoy such jurisdiction: It would be ideal if all states have legal authority over crimes committed on board vessels. However, the current state of international maritime law isn't that straightforward.\n\n(D) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea: This is an intergovernmental entity to interpret and apply the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, but it doesn't directly exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the answer is:\n\n(B) The flag State",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, it's essential to understand the definition and context of \"justiciability.\" Let's examine each option one by one:\n\n(A) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders: This definition focuses on the capacity to enforce rights by the rightful owners. While this definition has some relevance to the concept, it's too narrow and doesn't capture many important aspects of justiciability.\n\n(B) Justiciability refers to the just nature or cause of a particular right: This statement implies that justiciability concerns the inherent rights themselves. However, the focus should be on whether courts can and should interfere with the enforcement of rights.\n\n(C) Justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular rights conforms to principles of justice: This definition is closer to the essence of justiciability. It speaks to a court's power to review cases concerning rights and determine if non-enforcement is unjust. It fits the definition best so far.\n\n(D) Justiciability refers to the obligation of a State to enforce a particular Right: While this definition also relates to the enforcement of rights, it's more about states' obligations in enforcing rights, rather than the process justiciability involves.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the best definition is:\n\n(C) Justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular rights conforms to principles of justice",

            "question": "In what way is Responsibility to Protect (R2P) different from humanitarian intervention?\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The Responsibility to Protect (R2P) is different from humanitarian intervention in several ways, but one major distinction lies in the requirement of United Nations Security Council (UNSC) input and the potential use of armed force.\n\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis. This means that the decision to intervene in a state's internal affairs under R2P is not arbitrary, as it needs approval from the UNSC and has a specific goal of preventing or halting human rights abuses and atrocity crimes. On the other hand, humanitarian intervention is more open-ended and can be carried out in response to various types of humanitarian crises, not necessarily limited to those involving large-scale abuses.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C), as it highlights the differences between R2P and humanitarian intervention in terms of the decision-making process and their primary objectives.",

Considering the options provided, we can analyze them as follows:\n\nA) This option is a more elaborated version of the Lotus principle, also often referred to as the \"principle of effectiveness.\" It emphasizes that any restrictions upon the independence of states cannot be presumed. In other words, whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law.\n\nB) This option focuses on the fact that states can choose the court they submit their disputes to. While this is related to the subject, it doesn't cover the full scope of the Lotus principle.\n\nC) The lotus principle is generally not associated with enforcement jurisdiction on the high seas. This option doesn't directly address the principle.\n\nD) This option introduces the concept of customary law and its development, based on the combination of state practice and opinio juris.

The UK Constitution is called an unwritten or uncodified constitution because it does not exist as a single document like some countries. It is formed from various statutes, conventions, and court decisions.\n\n(D) The UK Constitution is based on a Bill of Rights: The UK does have a Bill of Rights (the Bill of Rights 1689), but it is just one of the many sources that contribute to the UK Constitution. It is not accurate to say it is the sole basis for the constitution.\n\nDeduced from the reasons outlined above, the best description of the UK Constitution is:\n(C) The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources.\n\nThus, the answer is C.",

The statement is true as Protocol 14 changed the formation of the committee that hears the admissibility cases.\n\n(B) Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility:\n\nExplanation: Protocol 14 indeed added a new criterion for admissibility, known as the \"third party issue criterion\". The protocol allows intervention in a case by a third party if a friendly solution has been sought or the intervention could assist the court in resolving the case. This statement is true.\n\n(C) Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights:\n\nExplanation: The Commission of Human Rights was not abolished but transformed into the Human Rights Council under the protocol.

Small islands classified by area aren't always rocks under UNCLOS.\n\n(B) This isn't correct. Islands without maritime zones still qualify as islands but don't necessarily mean they are rocks.\n\n(C) This seems plausible. According to the UN law of Sea, the term \"Rock\" refers to islands that are deemed not to be able to sustain human habitation or carry an economic life of their own under the 121 (3) article. Hence, they are not allocated Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) or continental shelves.\n\n(D) This definition is based on the capacity to support human habitation which contradicts the nature of rocks under UNCLOS as they cannot support human life.\n\nFrom the examination, We can conclude that:\n\n(C) Rocks are the islands which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own and according to article 121 (3) have no Exclusive Economic Zone or continental shelf.",

It determines the rights and obligations that these entities have under international law.\n\nNow, let's analyze each of the statements provided:\n\n(A) It means that only States are considered subjects of international law: This statement is incorrect, as international legal personality is not restricted solely to states. Other entities, such as international organizations, have rights and duties under international law as well.\n\n(B) It means having rights and duties under international law and a capacity to enforce these by or against the relevant actor: This statement is accurate. International legal personality implies that the entity has rights and obligations under international law and the ability to enforce them. This encompasses states, international organizations, and other entities.\n\n(C) It means that an entity may challenge the authority of States: This statement is incorrect. While entities that possess international legal personality may engage in disputes or have their rights violated by states, it does not inherently mean that they challenge the authority of other states.\n\n(D) It is a term that is meant to denote legal, as opposed, to physical persons under international law: This statement is true.
