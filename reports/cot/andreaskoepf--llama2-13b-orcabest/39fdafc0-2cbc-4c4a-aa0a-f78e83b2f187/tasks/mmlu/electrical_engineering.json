            "model_answer": "First, let's understand the Barkhausen criterion. The Barkhausen criterion is used to determine whether an oscillator will output a stable waveform or not. It is a necessary condition for an oscillator to operate in a stable manner.\n\nA) Loop gain should be unity. This statement is not correct. Loop gain should be greater than unity to ensure the oscillator's stability. A unity gain loop would not create an oscillation, as it would only amplify the signal without introducing any phase shift or feedback.\n\nB) Loop gain should be less than unity. This statement is also not correct. The loop gain should be greater than unity for an oscillator to operate stably. A gain less than unity would lead to attenuation rather than oscillation.\n\nC) The phase of a feedback signal with respect to input should be 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0. This statement is true. For astable oscillation, the phase of the feedback signal with respect to the input signal should be either 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0. This phase condition ensures that the feedback signal helps reinforce the amplitude, causing the oscillator to produce a stable waveform.\n\nD) Both A and C. This answer is partially right, as the phase condition (C) is correct, but loop gain should be greater than unity, not less (A). So, this option is almost correct but not entirely accurate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) The phase of a feedback signal with respect to input should be 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) It loads the circuit moderately.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The potentiometer method is used to measure DC voltage.\n2. The potentiometer method involves splitting the unknown voltage source into two equal parts by a slide wire.\n3. The unknown voltage source creates an e.m.f across two points in the circuit.\n4. One of the points is connected to the slide wire and the other one is taken as the reference point.\n5. The slide wire is connected to the scale of the moving coil galvanometer through an external voltage source.\n6. When the slide wire is at its mid-position, the e.m.f across the two points is equal to the e.m.f of the external voltage source.\n7. As the slide wire moves from the mid-position, it changes the potential difference between the two points, causing deflection in the galvanometer.\n8. By measuring this deflection, we can determine the unknown voltage without causing any significant loading to the circuit.\n9. The potentiometer method moderately loads the circuit, so it is more accurate compared to direct measurement using a voltmeter that could potentially load the circuit more significantly.",
