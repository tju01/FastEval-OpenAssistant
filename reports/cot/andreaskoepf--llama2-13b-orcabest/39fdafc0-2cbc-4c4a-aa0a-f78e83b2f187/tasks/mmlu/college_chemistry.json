            "model_answer": "First, let's understand what the rate of a zero-order chemical reaction is. The rate of a zero-order reaction is dependent on the concentration of the reactant itself and not on any other factors such as temperature, pressure, or the concentration of other reactants.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options given:\n\n(A) r = k ln[A]: This option says the rate is directly proportional to the natural logarithm of the reactant concentration. However, the rate in zero-order reactions should be directly proportional to the concentration itself.\n\n(B) r = k [A]^2: This option says the rate is directly proportional to the square of the reactant concentration. However, the rate should be directly proportional to the concentration itself in zero-order reactions.\n\n(C) r = k [A]: This option says the rate is directly proportional to the reactant concentration. This is in accordance with the definition of the rate in a zero-order reaction.\n\n(D) r = k: This option says the rate is directly proportional to the rate constant \"k\". However, the rate in a zero-order reaction should be directly proportional to the reactant concentration and not the rate constant.\n\nHence, based on the analysis, the correct answer is (C) r = k [A].",

This is indeed a possibility for the T1 duration being longer than the T2, so this is a potential reason.\n\n(B) If T2 is sensitive to very low-frequency molecular motions, it means that the resonance decays quickly due to the influence of these slow molecular vibrations. However, this should lead to a shorter T2, not a longer one.
