            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the given options. Gerontology, Geropsychiatry, Geriatrics, and Gero-education are terms related to the study of older adults and aging.\n\nStep 2: Match the term with its definition. Gerontology is the scientific study of the social, cultural, psychological, cognitive, and biological aspects of aging. Geropsychiatry is the study of mental health and behavioral disorders in older adults. Geriatrics is the branch of medicine that deals with the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases and disorders affecting older adults. Gero-education is not a recognized term related to the study of older adults and aging.\n\nStep 3: Determine the correct answer. Since gerontology is the term that refers to the study of older adults and aging as a whole, the correct answer is (A) Gerontology.",

            "model_answer": "Before proceeding with the answer, let us analyze the four given factors:\n\nA) Being African or Hispanic American: Some studies have suggested that certain ethnic groups, such as Hispanic Americans, might have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease; however, this factor is quite variable and it might not be valid for all cases.\n\nB) Eating fish: Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish are believed to be beneficial for brain health. Some research suggests that consuming fish or omega-3 supplements may reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nC) A lower level of education: There are indications that higher levels of education may be associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease, possibly due to cognitive stimulation and lifelong learning. \n\nD) Being married: Some studies show that married individuals, especially those with a strong marital relationship, may have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, possibly due to the support and engagement with their partner.\n\nBased on this analysis, the factor associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease is:\n\n(D) Being married",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand theDocility Hypothesis. The docility hypothesis is a theory that suggests there is a relationship between the level of environmental demands on an organism and its docility (different levels of behavioral response to stress, from highly active to passive).\n\nNow let's analyze each choice to find the correct answer:\n\n(A) Those with low capabilities are more vulnerable to environmental demands - This option suggests a negative relationship between capabilities and environmental demands, but the docility hypothesis is about a positive relationship between the environmental demands and docility, not vulnerability.\n\n(B) Those who experience high environmental demands become more docile - This choice matches the general idea of the docility hypothesis. It suggests a positive relationship between environmental demands and docility.\n\n(C) Those who experience high environmental demands become less docile - This option contradicts the original hypothesis since it suggests a negative relationship between environmental demands and docility.\n\n(D) Those with less capability are less vulnerable to environmental demands - This choice contradicts the docility hypothesis because it suggests a negative relationship between capabilities and environmental demands.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) Those who experience high environmental demands become more docile",

            "model_answer": "(D) Increasing social contacts\n\nExplanation:\n\n(A) Aerobic exercise - Aerobic exercise indeed helps in maintaining a healthy brain and can improve memory, but it specifically helps in increasing cardiovascular health, not directly improving normal memory.\n\n(B) Taking acetylcholine - Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter and not a direct way to improve normal memory.\n\n(C) Taking gingko \u2013 Ginkgo biloba is said to have memory-enhancing properties, but the evidence is not conclusive. There are better established methods to improve memory.\n\n(D) Increasing social contacts - Social interactions help improve memory by engaging more parts of the brain, providing mental stimulation, and aiding emotional well-being.

Cataracts become more likely as we age, and they are responsible for a significant number of vision problems in the elderly.\n\n(C) It becomes clouded: Similar to option (B), becoming cloudy is a normal part of the aging process in the lens, especially for the formation of cataracts.\n\n(D) It fills with fluid: This refers to the formation of a clear jelly-like substance called vitreous humor in the eye which fills the cavity behind the lens. While this process occurs in most people as they age, it is not specifically related to the lens itself.\n\nBased on this analysis, the option that does NOT usually occur to the lens of the eye as one grows older is:\n\n(B) It yellows",

While it might help with some aspects of cognitive function, it is less likely to impact the reaction time difference between younger and older adults directly compared to options A and B.\n\nAfter analyzing the options, we can conclude that:\n\n(A) Practice regular aerobic exercise and (B) Lift weights on a regular schedule seem to be the most relevant options for reducing the reaction time difference between younger and older adults.
