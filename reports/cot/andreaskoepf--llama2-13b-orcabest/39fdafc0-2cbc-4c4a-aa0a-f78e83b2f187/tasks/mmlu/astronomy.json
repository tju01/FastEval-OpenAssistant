            "model_answer": "I will first explain the characteristics of a type-Ia supernova.\n\nA type-Ia supernova, also known as a \"type one-a\" supernova, is thought to result from the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf in a binary system. This white dwarf accumulates mass from its companion star, such as a small- to medium-sized, cool, low-density star called a red giant or a less massive main sequence star. When the white dwarf reaches a critical mass, it undergoes a catastrophic explosion, leading to a type-Ia supernova.\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option:\n\n(A) This type occurs in binary systems: This is true as type-Ia supernovae are believed to occur due to the accretion of matter from a binary companion onto a white dwarf.\n(B) This type occurs in young galaxies: This is not necessarily true, as type-Ia supernovae can occur in both young and old galaxies, depending on the presence of a binary system.\n(C) This type produces gamma-ray bursts: This is not always true. While type-Ia supernovae are known to release a significant amount of energy, most of it is not in the form of a gamma-ray burst. A small fraction of type-Ia supernovae might give rise to gamma-ray bursts, but they are not the primary, or exclusive, mechanism for these bursts.\n(D) This type produces high amounts of X-rays: This is not true, as type-Ia supernovae primarily emit light at visible wavelengths and released a significant amount of energy in the form of light. However, they might also emit a small amount of X-rays and other types of radiation due to the interaction of the supernova's expanding debris with the surrounding material.\n\nBased on the information above, the answer is:\n\n(A) This type occurs in binary systems.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's evaluate each choice step-by-step:\n\nA) Its speed relative to you - The given information is about the actual brightness of the object and its apparent brightness from your location. Neither of these pieces of information tells us about the object's speed relative to you. Hence, it cannot be estimated using the given data.\n\nB) Its composition - The actual brightness and apparent brightness of the object do not give any information about the composition of the object. We cannot estimate its composition based on this information alone.\n\nC) Its size - The brightness of an object can provide some indication about its size. Generally, a brighter object appears larger in the sky as more of its light reaches the observer. However, since we only know the actual brightness and apparent brightness, it is difficult to accurately estimate the object's size without additional information.\n\nD) Its distance from you - Although the apparent brightness and actual brightness of an object can provide some information about its distance, it requires a bit of additional information, such as its angular size or the approximate distance of the object. The given information is not sufficient to determine the object's distance from you.\n\nBased on the analysis, no other options are correct. However, the question's formatting does not allow for this comprehensive response. Therefore, the output of the answer would be:\n\n(C) Its size",

            "model_answer": "The sky appears blue due to the interaction of light with molecules in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nTo arrive at the answer step-by-step:\n\n1) (A) - Although the gases in the atmosphere do have some color, it's not a major factor in the blue color of the sky.\n  \n2) (B) - While the sky does reflect some color from the Earth's oceans, it doesn't primarily explain the blue color.\n\n3) (C) - This is the main reason we get the blue color. The atmosphere scatters short wavelengths (blue light) more efficiently than longer wavelengths (red light). This phenomenon, called Rayleigh scattering, happens more with shorter wavelengths of light. These blue wavelengths come more directly from the sun, and are scattered all over the sky, creating a blue appearance.\n\n4) (D) - The Earth's atmosphere doesn't preferentially absorb all other colors. In fact, it actually allows them to pass through more easily than blue light.\n\nConsidering these explanations, the best answer is:\n\n(C) Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.",

When the attractive force between objects is tested through experiments and consistently provides results that support the theory, it starts to gain credibility. Repeating the experiment many times ensures reliability and reduces the chances of errors or flaws in the experiment itself.

This process is known as photolysis. The hydrogen atoms would then be lost to space due to thermal escape, which is a process whereby atoms are carried away by the high-speed outer layer of a planet's atmosphere as it is heated by the parent star.
