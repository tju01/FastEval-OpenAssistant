            "model_answer": "A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The suggestion is that adverts must not encourage unsafe practices, so the first word is \"Unsafe.\"\n2. Adverts are not supposed to cause distress or fear, as this can negatively impact the audience, so \"Distress\" and \"Fear\" are added.\n3. Adverts should not trivialize important issues. This means they should not be making light of things that really matter, so \"Trivial\" is the last word.\n4. The first letter of the answer is \"A\", which suggests that the correct answer is (A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, first, we need to understand the main topic of the question which is \"the obligations of workers towards their employer, based on individual contracts and wider employment laws.\"\n\nThe question is asking about the duties or obligations (which are actions or responsibilities required by a particular role or position) of workers towards their employers, which are regulated or set by individual contracts and employment laws.\n\nNow let's go through each option to find the best possible fit for the given question:\n\n(A) Employee rights: This term refers to the rights that employees have, such as the right to equal pay, safe workplace, and collective bargaining, among others. Rights are the freedoms and protection that individuals have, so this does not match the obligations of workers towards their employer.\n\n(B) Employee rights: This option is a repetition of option (A), so we don't need to consider this option.\n\n(C) Employer duties: This phrase is mainly associated with the obligations that employers must fulfill towards their employees. Examples include the duty to provide a safe workplace and pay at least the required minimum wage. So this term does not imply the obligations of workers towards their employer.\n\n(D) Employee duties: This term points towards the responsibilities that employees have towards their employers. It can include attendance, performance, and everything else employees must do in accordance with the terms of their employment and the law. This option seems to embody the idea mentioned in the question, i.e., the obligations of workers towards their employer.\n\nBased on the reasoning above,\n\n(D) Employee duties",

Like presenteeism, it does not directly address the ratio mentioned in the question.\n\n(C) Work-play balance is not a term typically used to describe an employee's ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities.\n\n(D) Work-life balance is an employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities, and due to changes in work and technology, the term has become more prominent in recent years.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Work-life balance",

However, it does not comprehensively define the concept described in the given statement.\n\n(B) Industrial ecosystems - This option can be considered a match for the concept described in the question. Industrial ecosystems refer to interconnected businesses that collectively contribute to a market or sector. The concept involves an ensemble of companies and industries, all of which are interconnected and rely on mutual benefits. This definition comprehensively fits the description in the statement.\n\n(C) Ecological ecosystems - These describe the natural environment and the interactions between living organisms and their surroundings. While this concept is related to the idea of interdependence, it does not specifically address the interaction between industries and their resources, which is a crucial aspect of the question.\n\n(D) Corporate ecosystems - This term is often used to describe the different types of relationships between companies, such as partnerships, competition, and collaboration. However, it does not account for the broader concept of resources and waste, which is inherent in the notion of industrial ecosystems and sustainability.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is:\n\n(B) Industrial ecosystems",

            "model_answer": "D) Informational asymmetries, Resources, Co-opted\n\nThe answer is (D) Informational asymmetries, Resources, Co-opted. \n\nThe reasoning behind this decision is as follows:\n\n1. The question discusses types of limitations and risks of business-CSO collaborations, which typically involve different organizations with distinct capabilities and interests.\n\n2. The first limitation mentioned is \"unfair distribution of ________\", where one party gains more from the relationship. This relates to an informational asymmetry, meaning that one party has better or more information than the other, potentially leading to an uneven distribution of benefits between the parties.\n\n3. The second limitation mentioned is \"______, where one party possesses more resources\". This suggests that inadequate resources could also be a challenge for business-CSO collaborations. \n\n4. Lastly, \"CSOs being ________\" means that civil society organizations could be vulnerable to co-option \u2013 meaning that they may be taken over or influenced by a more powerful entity.\n\nThe correct answer encompasses these three concepts: informational asymmetries, resources, and co-opting of CSOs.

            "model_answer": "To determine the most similar normative theory to corporate profit maximization, let's briefly examine each option:\n\n(A) Hedonistic Utilitarianism: This theory focuses on maximizing the overall personal happiness and pleasure by satisfying desires, but it doesn't directly emphasize profit maximization.\n\n(B) Preference Utilitarianism: This theory considers individual preferences and seeks to maximize the fulfillment of these preferences, which may indirectly encourage profit maximization for some individuals.\n\n(C) The Categorical Imperative: This is a Kantian moral theory that encourages acting in ways that follow certain rules and principles independent of the consequences. It doesn't focus on profit maximization.\n\n(D) Ethics of Care: This moral theory emphasizes the importance of personal relationships, empathy, and the well-being of others. It may not necessarily focus on profit maximization.\n\nBased on this brief analysis, Option (B) Preference Utilitarianism seems to be the most similar normative theory to corporate profit maximization, as it considers individual preferences and seeks to maximize individual satisfaction, which may lead to profit maximization in a corporate context.",

            "model_answer": "To deduce the correct answer, we need to analyze the question and hypothesize the possible relations between the three entities mentioned: regulation, CSOs, and businesses.\n\n1. Regulation implies a set of rules and standards that govern a particular domain. It's logical that regulation would pertain to the interaction with CSOs and the mechanics of a business operation.\n\n2. CSOs stand for Civil Society Organizations, which typically work with businesses to uphold certain standards in their operations. Given their function, interactions between CSOs and businesses are inevitable.\n\n3. Businesses form the underlying entity, which is being governed both by regulations and CSO activities. Mechanics are an important part of business operations, covering practices and execution of tasks. \n\nWith the hypothesis that Regulation concerns the interactions between CSOs and businesses and also extends to the mechanics of such processes, I will compare the given options:\n\n(A) Legal, Interactions, Mechanics: This option doesn't focus on 'CSOs,' which makes it less suitable than the other options.\n(B) Civil, Relations, Outcomes: This option suggests \"Civil,\" which is a vague term and doesn't convey the same ideas as 'CSOs.' Similarly, \"outcomes\" do not fit into the sentence.\n(C) Political, Interactions, Outcomes: This option aligns with the premise, involving regulation, interaction with CSOs, and the mechanics of such processes.\n\n(D) Environmental, Relations, Mechanics: While \"environmental\" has relevance, it's too specific, and the focus on relations and mechanics is too limited.\n\nAfter comparing the options, the best answer is:\n\n(C) Political, Interactions, Outcomes",
