            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct translation for \"murtis,\" let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) Offerings: This option suggests that murtis could be something that is offered or dedicated to God.\n\n(B) Prayers: This option implies that murtis may be the act of praying or communication with God.\n\n(C) Apparitions: This option indicates that murtis might be visions or supernatural appearances of holy figures or beings.\n\n(D) Idols: This option proposes that murtis refer to physical objects or images that represent divine figures.\n\nNow, let's research and gather information about the word \"murtis\" to identify its correct translation.\n\nAfter research, we can deduce that \"murtis\" is a Sanskrit term which primarily refers to idols or images representing deities. In Hinduism, murtis can be small, medium, or large and often used as aids to focus the mind during prayer or meditation. They can also be worshipped in homes or temples.\n\nBased on this information, the correct translation for \"murtis\" is:\n\n(D) Idols",

            "model_answer": "We are looking for a philosophy that is associated with naturalists who focused on natural elements and processes.\n\n(A) Daoism is a philosophy that emphasizes harmony with the Dao (\u9053) or the \"Way\" of the universe. Daoists often have a deep understanding of nature and its processes, so this could be a potential answer.\n\n(B) The Yin-Yang School is associated with the philosophy of balance between opposing forces in the natural world, including yin (\u9670) and yang (\u967d). This philosophy also focuses on the processes within nature.\n\n(C) Mengzi is a famous philosopher in the Confucian tradition, which is more focused on human relationships, morality, and social order, rather than natural elements and processes. So, this would not be the best answer.\n\n(D) Humanistic Buddhism is a form of Buddhism that puts emphasis on the study of human nature and emotions. While it might have some connections to natural elements, it does not focus primarily on them.\n\nAfter examining the options, the most suitable association for naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes are:\n\n(B) Yin-Yang School",

This term refers to the hymns or words of wisdom that Guru Nanak Dev, the founder of Sikhism, and subsequent Sikh gurus share as divine revelations.\n\n(B) Khalse: Khalse is a term not directly associated with Guru Nanak or Sikhism.

It refers to the consecration ceremony where a person becomes a disciple of the guru. While it signifies the Sikh identity, it is not the term for \"divine word\" as part of divine revelation.\n\n(D) Guru: This term refers to the spiritual teacher or leader in Sikhism.
