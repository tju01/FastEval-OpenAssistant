            "model_answer": "To determine the correct size of cannula for rapid blood transfusion in a patient, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Consider the patient's need for a timely blood transfusion, meaning we want a cannula that will easily create an access point for the blood transfusion without causing too much discomfort or damage to the patient.\n2. Compare the available options: (A) 18 gauge, (B) 20 gauge, (C) 22 gauge, and (D) 24 gauge.\n3. Standardize blood transfusion practice has evolved over the years. Gone are the days when only large bore cannulae were used for blood transfusions due to concerns of thrombosis. Instead, research now supports the safety and effectiveness of various cannula sizes for transfusion.\n4. Smaller cannula sizes are more comfortable for the patient and have fewer complications such as infection. However, with smaller cannula size, it is also important to ensure the cannula has sufficient flow to deliver the required blood quantity at a rapid pace.\n  \nAccording to current medical knowledge and practice, it would be safe to use both a 20 gauge cannula (B) and a 22 gauge cannula (C) for rapid blood transfusion. Patients may also require larger cannulae depending on their size, age, and other medical conditions, but with 20 and 22 gauge being commonly accepted sizes, we can prioritize patient comfort and appropriate blood flow.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the key attribute in successful marathon running, we will examine each option and its significance in marathon running.\n\n(A) strength: While strength is important for any endurance event, it is not the primary attribute for successful marathon running. Marathons require sufficient muscle strength, but other factors are more crucial.\n\n(B) power: Power is not the key attribute for successful marathon running because it generally refers to the ability to exert force over a short period of time, often in intense activities like sprinting or weightlifting. Marathon running requires consistent and sustained effort over a longer period, favoring other attributes.\n\n(C) stride length: Stride length can play a role in marathon running, as it affects efficiency and comfort in covering distance. However, the key attribute in successful marathon running is not necessarily the outcome of one specific characteristic like stride length.\n\n(D) stamina: Stamina is the ability to sustain effort over a long period, which is essential for successful marathon running. Marathon runners need to maintain a consistent pace for extended periods, requiring they have the endurance to run for hours without exhaustion.\n\nAfter considering each option, we can conclude that the key attribute in successful marathon running is stamina.\n\nAnswer: (D) stamina.",

It is responsible for 62% of dementia cases in the UK, making it the most common cause.\n\n(B) Cerebrovascular (stroke) disease: Strokes can result in vascular dementia, a form of dementia caused by problems in blood flow to the brain. Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia in the UK.\n\n(C) Lewy body dementia: Lewy body dementia is a rare form of dementia that affects about 2% of patients. It is not as common as Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia.\n\n(D) HIV infection: Although HIV can cause cognitive impairment, it does not typically result in dementia. The prevalence of HIV-related dementia is very low.\n\nNow, let's determine the commonest cause of dementia in the UK based on the prevalence of each option:\n\nAlzheimer's disease (62%) is more common than strokes (25%), which are more common than Lewy body dementia (2%).

It indicates a partial blockage or obstruction of the airways, and it could be present during a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).\n\n(B) Bradycardia: Bradycardia refers to a slow heart rate, typically less than 60 beats per minute. While it is a possible symptom of anaphylaxis, it is less common than the other options.\n\n(C) Severe wheeze: A wheeze is a whistling or squeaky sound when breathing, often caused by narrowed or constricted airways. Severe wheeze is a common symptom of anaphylaxis, leading to difficulty in breathing.\n\n(D) Rash: A rash is a general term for any change in the skin's appearance, such as redness, bumps, or hives. A skin rash can occur during anaphylaxis as a result of the body releasing histamines, which can cause symptoms like redness and itching.\n\nAnalyzing the options, we can conclude that (B) Bradycardia is NOT a symptom of anaphylaxis as common symptoms include stridor, severe wheeze, and rash, which are more directly related to airway constriction and allergic reactions.\n\nAnswer: (B) Bradycardia",

            "question": "With an increasing number of sprints the:\n\n(A) anaerobic contribution progressively increases.\n(B) pH of the muscle falls below 6.0.\n(C) blood glucose concentration falls below 3 mmol/L.\n(D) relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let us analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n1. With an increasing number of sprints, the anaerobic contribution progressively increases (A).\nThis is true because anaerobic energy systems (such as ATP-CP and glycolysis) provide quick energy during short-intensity activities like sprinting. As the number of sprints increases, the body experiences a higher demand for anaerobic energy production, leading to a progressively increasing anaerobic contribution.\n\n2. With an increasing number of sprints, the pH of the muscle falls below 6.0 (B).\nThis is false. Acid-base balance in muscles is a complex subject. During exercise, particularly high-intensity exercise like sprinting, there is an increase in hydrogen ion (H+) concentration due to anaerobic metabolism. This process leads to a decrease in pH, but it does not necessarily mean that the pH of the muscle falls below 6.0. The pH scale is logarithmic, meaning a decrease of one unit represents a 10-fold change in concentration. A pH of 6.0 is close to the lower limit for metabolic function.\n\n3. With an increasing number of sprints, the blood glucose concentration falls below 3 mmol/L (C).\nThis is false. Blood glucose concentration is regulated by hormones such as insulin and glucagon. During high-intensity activities like sprinting, the body maintains blood glucose within an adequate range to ensure energy production. The 3 mmol/L value is not a universally-accepted lower limit, and blood glucose concentration is unlikely to fall below that level during the course of sprinting.\n\n4. With an increasing number of sprints, the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases (D).\nThis is partly true. Despite the predominance of anaerobic energy production during sprinting, the aerobic contribution does increase with the increasing number of sprints. Aerobic metabolism, which utilizes oxygen for energy production, supports the recovery process. As the body replenishes depleted ATP from anaerobic metabolism, aerobic metabolism becomes more significant in increasingly long recovery periods between sprints. However, this increased aerobic contribution does not negate the prevailing anaerobic energy production during the active sprints.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the best answer is:\n\n(A) anaerobic contribution progressively increases.",

            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze the given statements in order to determine which statement is true about diplopia:\n\n(A) Diplopia is the perception of two separate images of a single object.

Generally, it's true as the inner image is usually the correct one, but it's not universally applicable in all cases of diplopia, and there might be cases where both images could be perceived as true. So, this statement is not universally true.\n\n(C) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards: This statement refers to a specific type of diplopia, where the patient experiences double vision when looking upwards. So, this statement is only true in this particular case.\n\n(D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint: A sixth nerve palsy does indeed cause a form of diplopia where the eyes are misaligned, with the gaze being directed upwards and outwards.

This increase in pH and buffering capacity allows for the faster removal of hydrogen ions from muscles. This process is beneficial for middle distance running performance as it helps to reduce muscle acidity and promotes a more efficient energy production.\n\nOptions B and C are incorrect because they mention reducing the pH or increasing hydrogen ion influx, which are not the effects of sodium bicarbonate ingestion.
