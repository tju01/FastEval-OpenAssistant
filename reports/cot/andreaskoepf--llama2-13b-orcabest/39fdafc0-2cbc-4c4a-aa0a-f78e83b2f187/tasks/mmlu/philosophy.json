            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let us analyze the term \"aesthetics\" first. Aesthetics is the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of beauty and taste, and it often concerns itself with art, music, and other creative expressions.\n\nNow, let's go through the options systematically:\n\n(A) essential to our existence: Aesthetics is not about the basic necessities we need to survive, but instead focuses on beauty and artistic expressions.\n\n(B) unimportant to most people: Aesthetics is important in many people's lives, particularly those who appreciate art and beauty. However, it might be unimportant to some individuals.\n\n(C) not essential to our existence: This answer is more in line with our analysis. Aesthetics is not essential to our existence since it doesn't focus on basic necessities for survival.\n\n(D) rarely viewed: This statement doesn't necessarily align with the purpose of aesthetics, which tends to focus on beauty, art, and creative expressions.\n\nBased on our analysis, the best option is (C) not essential to our existence since aesthetics deals with objects that primarily focus on beauty, art, and creative expressions, which are not crucial for our survival and existence.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "We must understand Plato's view on true beauty by examining his philosophy of Forms and the concept of ideal beauty.\n\nStep 1: Understand Plato's Forms\nPlato believed in the existence of abstract ideal forms, which were perfect, unchanging models of everything in the material world. These Forms are timeless, unchanging, and imperfect representation of the material world.\n\nStep 2: Relate Forms to true beauty\nAs per Plato's philosophy, true beauty is closely related to the Form of Beauty (or the Ideal Beauty), which is the perfect and unchanging representation of beauty. Therefore, true beauty would be associated with the Ideal Beauty, not with everyday objects, which are mere imperfect representations of the Forms.\n\nStep 3: Determine the answer\nComparing the options given, option C) everywhere in the natural world does not align with Plato's concept of true beauty being associated with the Ideal Beauty and therefore can be eliminated.\n\nNow, we are left with:\n\n(A) found in everyday objects \n(B) nonexistent \n(D) not of this world\n\nStep 4: Decide the answer\nAs per the understanding of Plato's view on true beauty, we can eliminate option B) nonexistent and D) not of this world, as true beauty is closely related to the Ideal Beauty, not being non-existent or out of this world in nature.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(A) found in everyday objects",
