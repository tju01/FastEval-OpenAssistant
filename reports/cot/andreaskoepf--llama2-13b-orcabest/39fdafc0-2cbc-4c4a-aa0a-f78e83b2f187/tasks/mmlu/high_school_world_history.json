By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze each author's description of the French Revolution:\n\n1. In Dickens's \"A Tale of Two Cities,\" the period is described as: \n\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way\u2014in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.\"\n\nThe description seems to have both positive and negative aspects and is characterized by contrasts (best/worst, wisdom/foolishness, Light/Darkness, etc.). It compares the period to the present time, suggesting being received in a superlative degree. This can be seen as reflecting a mix of hope, despair, change, and contrasts.\n\n2. In Wordsworth's \"The Prelude,\" the period is described as:\n\"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive. But to be young was very heaven.\"\n\nThis quote focuses on the thrill and excitement during this tumultuous time. The language used, such as \"bliss\" and \"heaven,\" highlights the positive and ecstatic feelings of being alive and young during this era.\n\nNow, let's consider the given adjectives and match them with the respective descriptions:\n\n(A) Optimistic, encouraged\n(B) Understanding, accepting\n(C) Cynical, enthusiastic\n(D) Sincere, resigned\n\n(A) Optimistic - In general, the description of Dickens's characterization is more positive and hopeful. Thus, the adjective \"optimistic\" aligns with this portrayal.\n\n(B) Understanding - Wordsworth focuses on the excitement of being alive during that period, conveying an understanding of the emotional experience.\n\n(C) Cynical - Neither description presents a cynical point of view.\n\n(D) Sincere - While their accounts may be based on personal experiences or perspectives, Dickens's depiction of the French Revolution leans more toward contrasting superlatives and ultimately appears to succumb to despair. Wordsworth's perspective is more about the enthusiasm for life rather than being sincere in accepting the period's complex nature.\n\nComparing the adjectives with the analysis of the authors' descriptions, the best fits for Dickens's and Wordsworth's differing views about the French Revolution would be:\n\n(A) Optimistic, encouraged - Dickens's (conveying hope and despair)\n(B) Understanding, accepting - Wordsworth's (showcasing the excitement of being alive)\n\nAnswer: (A) Optimistic, encouraged",

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.
