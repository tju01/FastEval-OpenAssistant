            "model_answer": "(B) Satisficing\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. Understand that the question is asking for a term describing a non-optimal but acceptable outcome of negotiations.\n2. Examine each option:\n\n   (A) Bargaining: This is the process of negotiating an agreement, but it doesn't imply an outcome that is sub-optimal but acceptable.\n   \n   (B) Satisficing: This term refers to reaching an acceptable, but not necessarily perfect, outcome of a decision-making process. It is particularly applicable to negotiation outcomes.\n\n   (C) Accepting: This term refers to simply agreeing to something; it doesn't necessarily imply a sub-optimal outcome.\n\n   (D) Compromising: While compromising does involve reaching a middle ground, it doesn't necessarily imply the outcome is sub-optimal but acceptable.\n\n3. Determine that option (B) Satisficing is the best fit for the description, as it specifically refers to an acceptable but not optimal outcome in decision-making processes.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the term for the \"rule of thumb\" type of decision-making, let's first examine each option:\n\n(A) Framing Bias: This is a cognitive error where people make decisions based on the way information is presented/framed rather than the actual content. It is not a \"rule of thumb\" type of decision-making.\n\n(B) Hindsight Bias: This occurs when someone believes that they could have known the outcome of an event, based on the results, even though they couldn't have known it beforehand. It might be seen as related to the \"rule of thumb\" but is not quite the same thing.\n\n(C) Over-confidence Bias: This occurs when people tend to overestimate their abilities and knowledge, which might lead them to have a \"rule of thumb\" type of decision-making but it does not specific to decision making.\n\n(D) Heuristics: Heuristics are problem-solving techniques that involve using mental shortcuts and simplifying rules. They can sometimes resemble \"rule of thumb\" r decision-making.\n\nThe most appropriate term for the \"rule of thumb\" type of decision-making biases is:\n\n(D) Heuristics",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is: \n(C) The way things should be.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. A normative perspective is a way of understanding or looking at something by referring to ideas about what is believed to be \"right\" or \"good.\"\n\n2. In order to determine an appropriate answer, we should carefully review each option and compare it to the definition of a normative perspective.\n\n3. (A) states that the normative perspective is \"the way things are.\" However, this simply describes the current state of affairs and does not take into account any notions of \"goodness\" or \"rightness,\" which are essential components of a normative perspective.\n\n4. (B) implies \"the way things are going to be,\" which is more about predicting future trends or events rather than focusing on how things should be. A normative perspective deals with evaluating something according to standards or principles, not simply predicting outcomes.\n\n5. (D) suggests \"the way things were,\" which is only relevant for historical analysis of how things were in the past. A normative perspective, on the other hand, typically considers the present and future implications of certain actions or decisions, and how they should be guided by moral or ethical standards.\n\n6. Finally, (C) states that the normative perspective is \"the way things should be.\" This is a plausible answer, as it aligns well with the general understanding of a normative perspective as involving evaluations based on principles or standards of what is right or good.\n\nTherefore, the answer that best describes the normative perspective is (C) The way things should be.",
