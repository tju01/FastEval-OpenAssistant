            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first explain the problem and resolve it step-by-step.\n\n1. Understand the problem: We have a photon detector with quantum efficiency 0.1. This means that the detector has a 10% chance of detecting a photon when one arrives. We want to find out how many times the detector would detect photons when 100 photons are sent one after the other.\n\n2. Analyze the approach: Since the detector's quantum efficiency is 0.1, we can use the Binomial probability formula to find the probability of detecting a photon and the number of successful detections. The formula for the Binomial probability is:\n\nP(n) = (n * p) / (1 * q)\n\nwhere P(n) is the probability of measuring n detections, n is the number of trials, p is the probability of success in a single trial (in this case, 0.1), and q is the probability of failure (1 - p).\n\n3. Evaluate the probability of detection: We have n = 100, p = 0.1, and q = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nP(100) = (100 * 0.1) / (1 * 0.9) = 10 / 0.9 = 11.11\n\n4. Calculate the number of successful detections: Since the probability of detection is 11.11 for 100 photons (meaning we can expect on average just a little over 10 detections), we can round this to approximately 11 to get a more reasonable number.\n\n5. Calculate the rms deviation: Recall that the rms deviation is a measure of dispersion or variation in a dataset. It is given by the square root of the variance. In this case, since the number of successes is the number of detected photons and there were 100 photons, we subtract 10 (the mean number of detected photons) from each value and sum the results:\n\nrms_deviation = sqrt(sum_i(pow(Number_of_detected_photons_from_each_trial - 10, 2)))\n\n6. Calculate the rms deviation: (We can further simplify the formula since we only care about the rough variation.)\n\nrms_deviation = sqrt(sum_i(pow(Number_of_detected_photons_from_each_trial, 2)) * (10 - sum_i(Number_of_detected_photons_from_each_trial)))\n\n7. Evaluate the final answer:\n\n(D) an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 0.1",
