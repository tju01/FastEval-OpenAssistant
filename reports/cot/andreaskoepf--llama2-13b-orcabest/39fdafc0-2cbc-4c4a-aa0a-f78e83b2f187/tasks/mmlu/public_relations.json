            "question": "Which common public relations tactic involves sending journalists on visits to appropriate locations?\n\n(A) Media release\n(B) Media tour\n(C) Press room\n(D) Promotional days/weeks",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze the characteristics of each option to see which one matches the description of a common public relations tactic used to send journalists on visits.\n\n(A) Media release: A media release is a formal statement or announcement distributed to media outlets. It differs from the question description, since it's not an actual tactic.\n\n(B) Media tour: A media tour involves taking journalists to specific locations, which may be of interest due to an event, a facility, or a company. In this case, the tactic aligns with the question's description, so we have a strong candidate.\n\n(C) Press room: A press room is a designated area used to accommodate members of the media, such as a place to hold press conferences or provide access to resources. Although a press room may be part of media tours, it is not a tactic itself.\n\n(D) Promotional days/weeks: Promotional days/weeks refer to specific periods set aside for promotional campaigns and events. Although these may involve media tours, it is not the tactic being asked about in the question.\n\nBased on how each option aligns with the description, we can conclude that the correct answer is:\n\n(B) Media tour",
