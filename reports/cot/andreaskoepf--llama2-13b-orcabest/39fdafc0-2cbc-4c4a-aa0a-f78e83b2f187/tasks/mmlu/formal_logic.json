The main argument is about the difficulty of convincing people of the unconscious because of the arrogance of consciousness and defense mechanisms.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible answer choices:\n\n(A) Reiterates the difficulty of verifying intelligence in peers due to emotions. This is related but not directly related to the main argument.\n\n(B) Focuses on the arrogance of consciousness and defense mechanisms, and their role in blocking unconscious complexes. This is aligned with the main argument.\n\n(C) Connects the difficulty of convincing people of the unconscious to their conscious knowledge contradicting. This suggests a result or consequence of the main argument.\n\n(D) Again points to the difficulty of persuading people of the unconscious and teach them what contradicts their conscious knowledge. This is very similar to (C) and another consequence of the main argument.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best choice that captures the conclusion of the main argument is (C) Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.",

This argument is connecting two statements together with a conditional: \"If not G then H.\"\n\nGiven the truth table breakdown:\n\n1. G is true and H is false: The true value of G is \"T,\" and H is false. In this case, \"~G \u2283 H\" is true since the conditional is verified, meaning if not G, then H.\n2. G is true and H is true: The true value of G is \"T,\" but H is also true. In this case, \"~G \u2283 H\" is false, meaning that if not G, then H is false because H contradicts the condition.\n3. G is false and H is false: The value of G is false, meaning \"G\" and \"~G\" are equivalent, and \"H\" is also false, making \"~G \u2283 H\" false.\n4. G is false and H is true: The value of G is false, and H is true, also making the argument false since the condition is not met.\n\nSince there are two cases where the given argument is false (numbers 2 and 4), we can conclude that the argument is invalid. Let's consider counterexamples for each invalid case.\n\nFor the case where both G and H are true (row 1 on the truth table):\n\nThe counterexample would consist of G = true and H = true. However, this contradicts the counterexample rule: If the original argument is to be false, at least one of G or H should be false. In this situation, both G and H are true, which means that the argument is not false, and in consequence also not a valid counterexample.\n\nFor the case where G is true and H is false (row 3 on the truth table):\n\nThe counterexample presenting a situation where G is true and H is false remains true since the conditional statement is false. This counterexample is valid as it contradicts the argument's hypothesis.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer based on our counterexample analysis would be option (C) Invalid.
