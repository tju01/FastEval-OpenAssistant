            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Let's go through this step by step:\n\n1. Arno Co. did not record a credit purchase of merchandise. This means that the transaction wasn't recorded in the company's books.\n\n2. The merchandise was included in the year-end physical inventory. This means that the merchandise still exists in the company and it's part of the overall inventory.\n\n3. The inventory is an asset for the company because it represents products that the company can sell and generate revenue.\n\nNow, let's consider the balance sheet:\n\nAt year-end, the balance sheet will show the company's assets and liabilities, with assets being the resources owned by the company and liabilities being the obligations of the company. In this case, we need to analyze the effect that not recording the merchandise purchase has on Arno Co.'s balance sheet.\n\nSince the merchandise was not recorded as an asset but is still part of the physical inventory, we can say that the reported assets are understated. If the merchandise was recorded properly, the assets would have been higher by the cost of the merchandise.\n\nThe correct answer, therefore, is:\n\n(C) Understated No effect\n\nThis means that at year end, Arno Co.'s balance sheet will show as if it has lower assets than it actually does. However, this does not affect the liabilities side of the balance sheet since the obligations have not changed.",

This statement is related to sampling risk, but it talks about nonsampling risk which can be considered as a valid alternative definition. \n\n(B) Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements. This statement is about auditors failing to recognize misstatements. Since it is about nonsampling risk, it may contribute to confusion.\n\n(C) Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks. This statement introduces the concept of sampling risk correctly, but it is not specific to a nonissuer.\n\n(D) Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective. This statement introduces an important concept present in all forms of audit risk, including sampling risk, even for nonissuers.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer, which is the final line in the given statements, is:\n\n(D) Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.\n\nAn auditor generally performs the following procedures regarding subsequent events:\n\n1. Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end to identify any transactions that may have occurred after the balance sheet date and may have a significant effect on the financial statements. This helps in determining the correct reporting of data.\n\n2. Inspect inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end. This is done to ensure that all significant inventory transactions are accounted for, and the inventory valuation is accurate.\n\n3. Test internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate. This step helps auditors verify if management has taken corrective measures to improve internal controls, reducing the risk of misstatements in the financial statements.\n\n4. Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited. It's essential to ensure that the information provided is accurate and consistent across different reporting periods. However, this step can partially help auditors identify subsequent events but might not cover all aspects of subsequent events.\n\nBy following the steps above, the auditor can better understand the overall financial situation of the client and the potential impact of subsequent events on the financial statements.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the effect on bond carrying amount, retained earnings, and the overstated/understated nature of the error, we must first understand the effects of using the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method.\n\nStep 1: Understanding the Straight-Line Method\nUnder the straight-line method, the remaining bond premium (or discount) is amortized over the life of the bond at equal periodic amounts until it is completely amortized. The interest expense is thus evenly distributed over the bond's life, causing an understatement of the interest costs in the early years and an overstatement in the later years.\n\nStep 2: The Difference between Straight-Line and Effective Interest Method\nThe effective interest method (EIM) matches the periodic interest expense to the actual amount remaining of bond premium (or discount) each period. The EIM better reflects the actual cost of the time value of money and results in lower interest costs in the early years and higher interest costs in the later years.\n\nNow let's analyze the consequences of Dean Co. using the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method.\n\nStep 3: Bond Carrying Amount\nSince the straight-line method overstates the periodic interest expenses in the later years of the bond, the bond's carrying value will be overstated. This means that at June 30, year 12, under the straight-line method, the bond carrying amount will be higher than it should be under the effective interest method.\n\nStep 4: Retained Earnings\nThe overstated bond carrying amount will lead to a higher amortized bond premium which means higher interest expense. This will result in lower net income under the straight-line method, which will create a lower balance in retained earnings.\n\nStep 5: Overstated vs. Understated\nGiven the steps so far, we can determine that the bond carrying amount and retained earnings were both affected by the error in the straight-line method. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n(A) Overstated Understated",
