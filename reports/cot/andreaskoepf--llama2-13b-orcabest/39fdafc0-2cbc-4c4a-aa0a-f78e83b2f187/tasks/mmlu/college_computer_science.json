Thus, a graph can have at most 4 connected components. Additionally, graphs with only one node or no edges will have 1 connected component, making the minimum number of components 1.\n\nNow, to understand the maximum number of connected components, let's think about the structure of such graphs:\n- For a graph on 10 nodes (G10) to have 6 edges, at least 6 edges are needed to connect all nodes. Since each pair of nodes is connected by at most one edge, we need a complete graph on 6 edges: K6. A complete graph on K6 has 2 connected components. There's a node of degree 5 and one node of degree 1 (which is connected to the remaining 5 nodes in the clique of degree 5). So, the graph is a union of 2 cliques: one with 5 nodes, and another with 1 node.\n\nThis means that, for complete graphs on 6 edges (G6), the maximum number of connected components can be either 2 or 1, depending on whether the graph forms a clique on 6 nodes or not. As there are graphs with 2 connected components and graphs with 1 connected component in this collection, the maximum number of connected components is 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) M = 10, m = 1",
