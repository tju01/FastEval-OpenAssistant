            "model_answer": "(A) Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, leads to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs.\n\nThis option highlights that while environmental changes may initially pose challenges to economic growth, they can ultimately lead to technological advancements beneficial to national security. This is because limited resources can drive innovation and adaptation. In the long run, these advancements could strengthen military capabilities.\n\n(B) Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n\nThis option states that environmental changes can indeed negatively impact national security by weakening the economic base that supports military capacity. However, it also points out that the implications of such changes are primarily human. Thus, the answer acknowledges both the potential negative impacts of environmental changes on national security interests and the human aspect involved in the resolution of these challenges.\n\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.\n\nThis option focuses on the distinction between internal and external environmental challenges. It suggests that external military threats remain the main concern for national security, while internal environmental problems are separate issues to be addressed separately. This approach may not fully recognize the interconnectedness of environmental changes and their potential effects on national security interests.\n\n(D) All of these options.\n\nThis option combines all preceding points and acknowledges that environmental changes can indeed be reconciled with national security interests. It highlights potential benefits resulting from innovation and adaptation as well as the need to address internal environmental challenges that may impact national security interests indirectly. Additionally, it underscores the human aspect of these changes, keeping in mind societal and human resilience and adaptability.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n\nExplanation:\n\nOption (A) presents a liberal perspective on future energy security by emphasizing the importance of interdependence among nations in terms of energy security. It argues that major powers have shared interests in maintaining and extending the free market system, making conflict over energy reserves less likely. This approach supports the peaceful cooperation between countries for the betterment of all.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(C) Human security is too broad.\n\nThe reason behind this choice is that human security is often criticized for being too broad and encompassing a wide range of issues, making it difficult to effectively address specific problems. While options A and B could be seen as criticisms, they are more political statements, and it's not clear if they directly criticize the human security concept itself. Thus, option C is the most accurate answer as it directly comments on the scope of human security.",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

Security studies became one of International Relations' (IR's) two pillars, the second being International Political Economy. Henceforth IR became the main disciplinary context in which security studies was deliberated.\n(D) Think tanks and policymakers are increasingly interrelated.

            "model_answer": "(D) Think tanks and policymakers are increasingly interrelated. The institutional blurring between universities, think tank, and policy has resulted in policy mergers at every level.\n\nReasoning:\nThe question asks about a potential problem for policy in the institutionalization of academe-policy interaction. The answer needs to focus on the relationship between academia and policy-making.\n\n(A) refers mainly to the disciplinary context for security studies, which is somewhat related, but it does not address the problem or the interaction between academia and policy directly.\n\n(B) mentions the role of think tanks shift from policy to politicization resistant theory, which does not directly address the interaction between academia and policy-making.\n\n(C) talks about the \"IR-ification\" of security studies, which again displays relevance by highlighting a disciplinary aspect, but it does not directly relate to policy issues or interactions.\n\nHowever,\n(D) specifically highlights the increasing interrelated nature of think tanks and policymakers, along with the blurring of institutional boundaries between universities, think tanks, and policy.
