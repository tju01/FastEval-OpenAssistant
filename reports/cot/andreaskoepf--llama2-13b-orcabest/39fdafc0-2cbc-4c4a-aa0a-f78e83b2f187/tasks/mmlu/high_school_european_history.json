            "model_answer": "In the passage, Huxley thus explains what the term \"Protoplasm\" is and suggests it's the foundation of life. He highlights its break-up into common elements of the environment: carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds. This is indicative of the idea that life is not separate from matter but essentially made of it. So, the correct inference would be that Huxley argued that life was (A) a force that works through matter, as the matter of life (according to Huxley) breaks up into common elements when its manifestation ceases. Huxley doesn't imply in the passage that life is a force, but he does argue that life is something that manifests through matter thereby linking the two intrinsically. The other options do not align with Huxley's way of thinking about \"life\" according to the given text. He definitely doesn't mention life as a philosophical notion (B), something solely properties of particular type of matter (C), nor does he treat it as a supernatural phenomenon (D).

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure.

We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.
