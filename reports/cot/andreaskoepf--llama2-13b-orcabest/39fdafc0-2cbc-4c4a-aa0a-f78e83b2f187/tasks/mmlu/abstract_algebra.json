            "model_answer": "Let's first understand the normal way we find degrees of extension subfields over a base field. We use the theory of Galois extensions and end up computing a number called the degree of the extension that gives us the data about the functionality of the operation of the extension.\n\nHere, the base field is Q, which is the field of rational numbers. Our given extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is a splitting field because it's the smallest field extension which contains all the elements of Q and also elements sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18). Notice that we have 3 different \"roots\", none of which are linearly dependent over Q.\n\nBecause our extension is a product of three distinct quadratic fields (Q(sqrt(2)), Q(sqrt(3)), Q(sqrt(18))), these roots are distinct and non-zero. Thus, this splitting field is not Galois which means it's not a simple extension. \n\nInstead, we need to find an upper bound for the degree of the extension by looking at each element of the extension and its minimal polynomial over Q.\n\nNow we know that, every rational function in Q[x] / (x^4-2), x^4-3, and x^4-18) decomposes as a product of linear factors over Q(sqrt(3)) and also over Q(sqrt(18)) and Q(sqrt(2)) independently. But over Q(sqrt(3)), (x^4-2), (x^4-3), (x^4-18) are pairwise distinct and irreducible. Therefore, it's enough just to consider one of them, let's say (x^4-2).\n\nThe degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is then 4 as the smallest divisor of (x^4-2) over Q is 4.\n\nSo, the degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is 4,matches with the option (B) of the question.",

A ring homomorphism is a function from one ring to another ring which preserves ring structures, meaning it maps the addition, multiplication, and identity elements correctly. A kernel is the subset of elements in the domain of a ring homomorphism that get mapped to the identity element in the codomain. {0} would mean the null ring, with no nonzero elements.\n- The statement claims that a ring homomorphism is one to one (invertible) if and only if its kernel is {0}. Let's prove it:\n  1. If a ring homomorphism is one to one, then for every nonzero element a in the domain, there exists a unique element b in the codomain such that f(a) = b (f is the homomorphism). The kernel must contain all the nonzero elements that get mapped to the zero element. So, the kernel must be {0}.\n  2. If the kernel is {0}, then for every nonzero element a in the domain, f(a) cannot be the identity element in the codomain (since f is injective). Therefore, each nonzero element a gets mapped to a unique a in the codomain.

We can represent both of these power series as follows:\n\nQ(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) = X(A + B)\nQ = Y(1 + P)\n\nHere, A and B are coefficients such that A + B = 0 because Q(-sqrt(2) - sqrt(3)) = 0.

Let's find the coefficients of Y to the powers 1 (P), 2 (P^2), 3 (P^3), and 4 (P^4):\n\n1. Y(-1 + P^2)^1 = Y^1 = 1\n2. Y(-1 + P^2)^2 = Y^2 = (-1)^2 = 1\n3. Y(-1 + P^2)^3 = Y^3 = (-1)^3 = -1\n4.
