Richard was last seen at the electronic store at 8pm, so he must have gone to the physics classroom sometime before then.\n\nNext, we should identify the latest time Richard could have gone to the physics classroom. David saw Richard reading at the library from 10am to 11am, so he could not have gone to the physics classroom during that time. Richard was also seen by Samantha and Ashley at 11am and 2pm, respectively, so he could not have gone to the physics classroom during those times.\n\nFinally, we can determine the timeframe during which Richard could have gone to the physics classroom. Since he went before 8pm, and his earliest possible time was after the times David, Samantha, and Ashley saw him, we can conclude that the correct answer is:\n\n(D) 4pm to 8pm",

This eliminates option (B).\n- David was seen at the train station from 7am to 12pm, so he couldn't have gone to the gas station during that time.

This eliminates option (C).\n- Michael saw David waiting at the train station from 7am to 12pm, which means that David could only have gone to the gas station after 12pm. This means that the gas station was still open after 8pm, which eliminates option (B).\n- Thomas saw David sitting on a rooftop from 12pm to 2pm, which means that David could only have gone to the gas station after 2pm.

This means that William was at the tennis court during the 11am to 1pm time frame. However, since he woke up at 9am, it's possible that he went to the coffee shop before going to the tennis court. So the earliest time he could have gone to the coffee shop is 9am.\n\n- Emily saw William attending class at the school from 11am to 1pm. This means that William was at school during this time and not at the coffee shop. So the latest time he could have gone to the coffee shop is before 11am.\n\n- Nancy saw William walking in the garden from 6pm to 7pm. This tells us that he was not at the coffee shop during this time. However, since the coffee shop was closed after 7pm, we can assume that William went to the coffee shop before 6pm.
