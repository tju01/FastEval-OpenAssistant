            "model_answer": "To find the degree of the given field extension, we need to determine the number of elements in the extension field that are not in the base field.\n\nThe base field is Q, which is the field of rational numbers. The extension field is Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)), which contains the rational numbers as well as the three elements sqrt(2), sqrt(3), and sqrt(18).\n\nWe can use the fact that the degree of a field extension is equal to the number of elements in the extension field that are not in the base field. In other words, the degree is equal to the dimension of the space spanned by the elements of the extension field that are not in the base field.\n\nTo determine the elements of the extension field that are not in the base field, we can express each element of the extension field as a rational expression involving the elements of the base field:\n\nsqrt(2) = (1 + sqrt(2))/2\nsqrt(3) = (1 + sqrt(3))/2\nsqrt(18) = (3 + 2sqrt(6))/2\n\nSquaring each of these rational expressions and reducing the fraction gives us the following elements not in the base field:\n\n(1 + sqrt(2))^2 = 4 + 2 = 6\n(1 + sqrt(3))^2 = 4 + 3 = 7\n(3 + 2sqrt(6))^2 = 36 + 24 + 18sqrt(6) = 84 + 144 = 228\n\nSo the space spanned by the elements of the extension field that are not in the base field has dimension 3. This means that the degree of the field extension is:\n\nDegree = (# of elements in extension - # of elements in base) / 2\nDegree = (3 - 2) / 2\nDegree = 1 / 2\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) 6",

The Galois group of a field extension is a group that describes the automorphisms of the extension field that preserve the extension.\n\nSince the extension is not solvable by radicals (i.e., it is not of the form Q(alpha) for some rational number alpha), it must be a splitting field of a separable polynomial. Let f(x) be a separable polynomial over Q that splits completely in Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) (i.e., every root of f(x) in Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) is a separable element). Then, Galois group of the extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q is the group generated by the automorphisms fixing f(x).\n\nWe can use the fact that every automorphism of a finite field extension is conjugate to a matrix with integer entries to determine the possible Galois groups. Specifically, if the Galois group is cyclic (i.e., generated by a single automorphism), then the automorphism must be conjugate to a matrix with integer entries, and we can determine the numbers that must appear on the main diagonal of the matrix.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nQ(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) = Q(sqrt(3) + sqrt(6)) = Q(sqrt(6)) (since sqrt(2) = 1 + sqrt(6) and sqrt(3) = 1 + 2sqrt(6))\nf(x) = x^2 - 2\n\nThe splitting field of f(x) at sqrt(6) is Q(sqrt(6)) = Q[sqrt(6)]/(x^2 - 2). Since sqrt(6) is a separable element in Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)), the polynomial splits completely in the extension field. Therefore, the Galois group is cyclic of order 2. \n\nThis gives us two possible automorphisms:\n\n1. x -> x\n2. x -> -x\n\nBoth automorphisms preserve the splitting field of f(x), so we can conclude that the field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q is a Galois extension of degree 2. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) 2",
