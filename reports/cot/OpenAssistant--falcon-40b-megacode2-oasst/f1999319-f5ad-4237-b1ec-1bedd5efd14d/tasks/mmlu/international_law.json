            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Crimes committed on board vessels are covered by the concept of \"jusridictional complementarity\" in international law. Determining which state has jurisdiction over a crime committed on a vessel is based on the following factors:\n\n* the nationality of the vessel\n* the flag state\n* the states that have direct interest\n* the states where the accused are nationals\n\nSince the crime was committed on board a vessel the vessel is likely to be of some nations. By corollary it will be registered under the flag of one of those nations. Ports and harbours will be owned and administered by a state so if the vessel visits that port at any time it will be owned and administered by a state. Each state will have expatriates.\n\nCombining these factors, each crime will fall under the jurisdiction of the coastal state.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) The coastal State.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's break down and understand the concepts of Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and humanitarian intervention.\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention: This statement is not entirely accurate. R2P is a principle that was endorsed by the United Nations in 2005, which states that individual countries have a responsibility to protect their citizens from mass atrocities, such as genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. It is primarily a tool for member states to take collective action in response to such situations. On the other hand, humanitarian intervention refers to military action taken for the purpose of protecting civilians from severe human rights abuses, such as genocide or ethnic cleansing. While both R2P and humanitarian intervention aim to protect civilians, their approaches and scopes are different.\n\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress: This statement is false. R2P is primarily an international responsibility, and it does not require a call for assistance from the State in distress. The responsibility lies with the international community to take action to protect civilians, either through diplomatic means or, in some cases, through military intervention.\n\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis: This statement is mostly accurate. R2P is designed to be a more structured and less arbitrary process compared to humanitarian intervention. The UN Security Council (UNSC) has the primary responsibility to determine whether R2P should be invoked, and it must approve any military action taken in response. Additionally, the primary objective of R2P is to prevent or halt mass atrocities, rather than solely to protect civilians. This distinction helps to ensure that R2P is not used as a pretext for military intervention based on other motivations.\n\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not: This statement is not entirely accurate. While R2P may involve armed force in some cases, it is not always necessary. R2P includes a range of measures, including diplomatic and economic sanctions, to prevent or respond to mass atrocities. On the other hand, humanitarian intervention typically involves military force to protect civilians from immediate harm. However, it is worth noting that both R2P and humanitarian intervention can involve armed force, depending on the specific situation.\n\nBased on the analysis of the statements provided, the answer to the question is:\n\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step:\n\n(A) This option suggests that states have a strict obligation to resolve their disputes as quickly as possible. While resolving disputes quickly can be considered peaceful, this option seems to focus more on the result rather than the process of settling disputes peacefully.\n\n(B) This option states that states have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means, but not necessarily to resolve them. This option aligns with the idea of an obligation to pursue peaceful settlement, but not necessarily to achieve it.\n\n(C) This option suggests that peaceful dispute settlement is a peremptory norm of international law, meaning it is a fundamental rule that cannot be derrogated from. It also mentions that all states have a legal interest in upholding this norm in any given dispute. This option strongly aligns with the idea of an obligation to pursue peaceful settlement.\n\n(D) This option states that the obligation of peaceful dispute settlement concerns solely international courts and tribunals. While these entities may play a role in peaceful dispute settlement, this option does not fully capture the obligation of states to pursue peaceful settlement.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, it is clear that option (C) best captures the obligation of states to pursue peaceful settlement of disputes:\n\n(C) It is a peremptory norm of international law and all States have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's break down the options and assess whether they are treaty-based human rights mechanisms:\n\n(A) The UN Human Rights Committee: This is a treaty-based body established to monitor implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). It reviews periodic reports from State parties, consider individual complaints, and issue general comments on the interpretation of the treaties. Therefore, this is a treaty-based human rights mechanism.\n\n(B) The UN Human Rights Council: This is also a treaty-based body established to promote and protect human rights around the world. It oversees the work of all UN human rights mechanisms, adopts resolutions on human rights situations, and can establish special procedures, such as fact-finding missions or commissions of inquiry. Therefore, this is also a treaty-based human rights mechanism.\n\n(C) The UN Universal Periodic Review: This is not a treaty-based human rights mechanism. It is a process in which the human rights record of all 193 UN member states is reviewed every four and a half years. It is a forum for dialogue and cooperation on human rights issues, but it does not have the authority to investigate or sanction violations.\n\n(D) The UN special mandates: This is not a specific mechanism, so it's difficult to assess whether it's treaty-based or not. However, most UN special mandates related to human rights are established by the UN Human Rights Council or the UN General Assembly through resolutions, which are not legally binding treaties. The UN special rapporteurs, for example, are appointed by the Human Rights Council to report on specific human rights issues or situations.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) The UN Human Rights Committee",
