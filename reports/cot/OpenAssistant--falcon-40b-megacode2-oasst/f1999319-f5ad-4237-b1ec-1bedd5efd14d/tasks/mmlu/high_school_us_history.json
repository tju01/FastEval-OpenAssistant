            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, let us define nativism: Nativism is a political and social movement that seeks to restrict the influence or presence of newcomers or immigrants in a given society. It often involves a fear or suspicion of outsiders and a preference for established, native-born citizens. With this definition in mind, let's examine each of the legislative acts listed:\n\n(A) The Wagner Act of 1935: This act established the National Labor Relations Board and provided workers with the right to join unions and engage in collective bargaining. It does not appear to be an example of nativism, as it pertains to labor relations rather than immigration.\n\n(B) The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798: These acts were a series of four laws passed by the Federalist-controlled U.S. Congress during the presidency of John Adams. They aimed to restrict the civil liberties of aliens (immigrants who were not yet citizens) and limit the rights of free speech, especially criticism of the government. This act is a clear example of nativism, as it sought to restrict the civil liberties of immigrants.\n\n(C) The Espionage Act of 1917: This act was passed during World War I and aimed to restrict speech and other activities that were considered supportive of the enemy or detrimental to the war effort. While it did limit some civil liberties, it was not specifically aimed at immigrants or newcomers. Therefore, it is not a clear example of nativism.\n\n(D) The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965: This act abolished the national origin quotas that had been in place since the 1920s and instead established a preference system for immigrants based on family relationships and skills. It also increased the overall number of visas available and granted admission to immigrants from countries with historically low levels of immigration to the United States. This act was not an example of nativism, as it sought to expand immigration rather than restrict it.\n\nBased on these definitions and analyses, the legislative act that is most closely an example of nativism is:\n\n(B) The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's consider the context provided. Hull House was a settlement house in Chicago that was founded by Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr in 1889. The purpose of settlement houses was to provide education, social services, and other assistance to poor and underprivileged people in urban areas. Settlement house workers were typically women who were dedicated to improving the lives of those in need.\n\nNow let's examine each of the answer choices in relation to the context:\n\n(A) The Social Gospel: The Social Gospel was a late 19th-early 20th century Protestant religious and social reform movement that emphasized the application of Christian principles to social issues such as poverty, inequality, and social injustice. This aligns with the mission and values of settlement houses, making it a likely motivation for settlement house workers.\n\n(B) Social Darwinism: Social Darwinism was a late 19th-century theory that applied the principles of Darwin's theory of evolution to human societies and argued that the fittest individuals and groups would naturally rise to the top while the weaker ones would fall to the bottom. While some people during this time may have been influenced by Social Darwinism, it does not seem to be a likely motivation for settlement house workers, who were more focused on helping those in need rather than promoting competition and survival of the fittest.\n\n(C) Communism: Communism is a political and economic ideology that advocates for the abolition of private property and the establishment of a classless, egalitarian society. While some settlement house workers may have had socialist or radical political beliefs, it is unlikely that communism was a primary motivation for the majority of settlement house workers, who were more focused on practical assistance and social reform.\n\n(D) The support of an urban political machine: Urban political machines were powerful political organizations that controlled local politics and provided patronage to their supporters. While some settlement house workers may have had alliances or connections with political machines, it is unlikely that this was their primary motivation, as their focus was on helping people in need rather than advancing political careers or interests.\n\nBased on the context and analysis of the answer choices, the most likely motivation for a settlement house worker was:\n\n(A) The Social Gospel",
