            "model_answer": "The human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) are a group of small DNA viruses that can cause a variety of diseases in humans, including skin warts, respiratory infections, and cancers. To answer this question, let us go through the following steps:\n\n- Determine the definition of human polyomaviruses: Human polyomaviruses are small DNA viruses that infect humans and can cause various diseases.\n\n- Research the current number of known human polyomaviruses: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other sources, there are currently nine recognized human polyomaviruses (HPyVs). These are:\n\n  - Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV)\n  - Human BK virus (HBKV)\n  - Human JC virus (JCV)\n  - Simian virus 40 (SV40)\n  - KI virus (KIV)\n  - WU virus (WUV)\n  - Malawi polyomavirus (MWPV)\n  - Tauranga Harbour virus (THV)\n  - Lymphotropic papovavirus (LPV)\n\n- Match the number of known human polyomaviruses to the given options: Since there are nine recognized human polyomaviruses, the correct answer is (C) 10.\nAfter going through these steps, the answer is:\n(C) 10",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the best answer option, we need to consider the factors mentioned in the question: limited access to safe water and low levels of education. We can eliminate answer (A) immediately because formula requires safe water for preparation, which is not guaranteed in countries with limited access to safe water. So, we are left with options (B), (C), and (D).\n\nFor infants in countries with limited access to safe water, it is important to minimize the risk of waterborne diseases. Breast milk is a natural and safe form of hydration and nutrition for infants, and it does not require the use of safe water for preparation. Therefore, answer (B) (exclusively breast fed for six months) would be a reasonable choice in this scenario, as it reduces the risk of waterborne diseases and does not depend on access to safe water for preparation.\n\nHowever, answer (C) (should receive both breast milk and other foods as tolerated in the first 6) is also a reasonable choice because it allows the infant to receive additional nutrients from other foods, which may be necessary in cases where the mother's breast milk is not sufficient or available.\n\nAnswer (D) (exclusively formula fed for six months) is not a suitable option because it requires the use of safe water for preparation, which is not guaranteed in countries with limited access to safe water.\n\n(B) Exclusively breast fed for six months",

            "model_answer": "The most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system is (D) Clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells. I will explain my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n- Antibodies (A) are important for the adaptive immune system as they can recognize and neutralize pathogens. However, they are not unique to the adaptive immune system, as some invertebrates have similar molecules that serve a similar function.\n- T cells (B) are also important for the adaptive immune system, as they can recognize and destroy infected cells or help other immune cells. However, they are not the most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system because they are also found in some invertebrates.\n- Memory T cells (C) are a type of T cell that can remember previous infections and mount a faster and stronger response if the same pathogen is encountered again. While this is an important feature of the adaptive immune system, it is not the most special characteristic because it is not unique to the adaptive immune system.\n- Clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells (D) is a unique feature of the adaptive immune system. During an infection, some B cells or T cells recognize and bind to a specific antigen on the pathogen. These cells then undergo clonal expansion, where many copies of the same cell are produced, all recognizing the same antigen. This allows the adaptive immune system to produce a large number of cells that are specifically targeted against the pathogen, making the immune response much more precise and effective. This feature is not found in invertebrates or other types of immune systems, making it the most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system.",
