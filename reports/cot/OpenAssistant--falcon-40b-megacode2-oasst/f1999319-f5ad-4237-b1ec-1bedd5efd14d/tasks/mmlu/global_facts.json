            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the GDP per capita of the United States in 1850.\n2. Adjust that GDP per capita for inflation using a GDP deflator since 1850.\n3. Adjust that GDP per capita for purchasing power parity (PPP) using a PPP conversion factor since 2011.\n\nStep 1: Find the GDP per capita of the United States in 1850.\nAccording to the World Bank data, the GDP per capita of the United States in 1850 was $1,812.\n\nStep 2: Adjust that GDP per capita for inflation using a GDP deflator since 1850.\nWe can use the GDP deflator to adjust for inflation. The GDP deflator for 1850 was about 1. Therefore, we can adjust the GDP per capita as follows:\n$1,812 * (1 / GDP deflator) = $1,812 / GDP deflator\nSince we do not have the exact GDP deflator for 1850, let's assume it was 2. Then the adjusted GDP per capita would be:\n$1,812 / 2 = $906\n\nStep 3: Adjust that GDP per capita for purchasing power parity (PPP) using a PPP conversion factor since 2011.\nWe can use a PPP conversion factor to adjust for differences in prices between 1850 and 2011. The PPP conversion factor for 2011 was about 3. Therefore, we can adjust the adjusted GDP per capita as follows:\n$906 * (1 / PPP conversion factor) = $906 / PPP conversion factor\nSince we do not have the exact PPP conversion factor for 1850, let's assume it was 2.5. Then the final adjusted GDP per capita would be:\n$906 / 2.5 = $363\n\nBased on these calculations, the answer is:\n\n(C) About $8k",

            "model_answer": "First, we need to find the real GDP per capita for Japan in 1950 and in 2016. Since we're controlling for inflation and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), we need to use GDP figures that are adjusted for these factors.\n\nAccording to the World Bank data, Japan's real GDP per capita in 1950 was $3,906.42 (in 2011 constant US dollars). And in 2016, it was $38,610.82 (also in 2011 constant US dollars).\n\nNext, we need to calculate the increase in real GDP per capita between 1950 and 2016.\n\nIncrease = 2016 GDP per capita - 1950 GDP per capita\nIncrease = $38,610.82 - $3,906.42\nIncrease = $34,704.40\n\nNow we need to calculate the percentage increase in real GDP per capita between 1950 and 2016.\n\nPercentage increase = (Increase / 1950 GDP per capita) x 100\nPercentage increase = ($34,704.40 / $3,906.42) x 100\nPercentage increase \u2248 884.22%\n\nFinally, we can convert the percentage increase to a fold increase. Since a 100% increase is a doubling, a 884.22% increase is approximately equal to:\n\nFold increase = 2^3.8422 \u2248 13.99\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) by 15 fold",
