            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the appropriate size of cannula for a rapid blood transfusion, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n- The diameter of the cannula, which is inversely proportional to the gauge number. A lower gauge number indicates a larger diameter.\n- The volume of blood that needs to be transfused. A larger diameter cannula will allow for faster transfusion of blood.\n- The risk of complications, such as clotting or infection, which may be increased with a larger diameter cannula.\n\nBased on current medical knowledge (as of 2020), a 22 gauge cannula is commonly used for rapid blood transfusions. This size provides a good balance between the need for fast transfusion and the risk of complications.\n\nSo the answer is (C) 22 gauge.",

However, it is not the key attribute in successful marathon running.\n\n(C) Stride length: While a longer stride can result in increased speed, it is not the key attribute in successful marathon running, as it can also lead to inefficiency and increased energy expenditure.\n\n(D) Stamina: Stamina is the ability to endure prolonged physical exertion without fatigue. It is the most critical attribute for successful marathon running, as it enables a runner to maintain a consistent pace for the entire distance.\n\nTherefore, the key attribute in successful marathon running is:\n\n* (D) stamina",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Let's go through each answer choice step-by-step:\n\n(A) Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered:\nDiplopia is the perception of two images of the same object. If one eye is covered, the brain will only receive information from the uncovered eye, and no diplopia should occur. However, this is not always the case, as other factors like a misalignment of the eyes or a problem with the brain can still cause diplopia even if one eye is covered. Therefore, this statement is not always true.\n\n(B) The outer image is always the false image:\nIn diplopia, there are usually two images being perceived - an inner image and an outer image. The outer image is typically the one that is seen more peripherally, while the inner image is seen more centrally. However, this does not always mean that the outer image is the false image. It depends on the underlying cause of the diplopia. For example, if there is a misalignment of the eyes, the outer image may actually be the true image, while the inner image is distorted.\n\n(C) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards:\nA fourth nerve palsy is a condition where the fourth cranial nerve, which controls the movement of the eye, is affected. This can cause upward deviation of the eye (also known as hypertropia) when the patient looks upwards. However, it is not necessarily true that the palsy only occurs when the patient looks upwards. It can occur in other situations as well.\n\n(D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint:\nA sixth nerve palsy is a condition where the sixth cranial nerve, which controls the movement of the eye, is affected. This can cause a divergent squint, where the affected eye turns outward. However, it is not the only cause of a divergent squint. Other conditions like a fourth nerve palsy or a third nerve palsy can also cause a divergent squint.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered",

            "model_answer": "In order to answer this question, let's first analyze each answer choice and evaluate whether it is consistent with the known effects of sodium bicarbonate ingestion on middle distance running performance.\n\nChoice (A): Elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allows a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle. This is consistent with the known effects of sodium bicarbonate ingestion, as it helps to alkalize the blood and reduce acidity in the muscles.\n\nChoice (B): Reducing the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allows a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle. This is not consistent with the known effects of sodium bicarbonate ingestion, as it would actually cause a decrease in performance rather than an improvement.\n\nChoice (C): Elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allows a faster influx of hydrogen ions into muscle. This is not consistent with the known effects of sodium bicarbonate ingestion, as it would cause an increase in acidity and decrease performance.\n\nChoice (D): Elevating the pre-exercise muscle pH. While sodium bicarbonate ingestion does help to alkalize the blood and increase muscle pH, the primary mechanism is through the buffering of hydrogen ions, not by directly increasing muscle pH.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) Elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to know how fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria for \u03b2-oxidation.\n\nFatty acids are activated by being converted into acyl-CoA molecules through the action of acyl-CoA synthase. This enzyme adds a coenzyme A molecule (CoA) to the fatty acid, creating a thioester bond. The activated fatty acid is then transported into the mitochondria via the carnitine shuttle. Carnitine acts as the carrier, binding to the activated fatty acid (acyl-CoA) and shuttling it across the mitochondrial membrane.\n\nOnce inside the mitochondria, the fatty acid is removed from carnitine by another enzyme, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1), which transfers the fatty acid onto carnitine to form a fatty acylcarnitine. This fatty acylcarnitine can then enter the \u03b2-oxidation pathway to be broken down for energy production.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) carnitine.",
