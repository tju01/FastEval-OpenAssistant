            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first briefly explain Hart's distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation.'\n\nHart's distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation' is a central concept in his legal philosophy. According to Hart, a rule of recognition creates and defines the law, but it does not impose obligations by itself. Rather, it is the existence of valid and authoritative secondary rules that impose obligations on individuals.\n\nA secondary rule creates an obligation when it is backed by a coercive power that can monitor and enforce compliance with the rule. In other words, an obligation arises not merely from the content of the rule itself but from the fact that there is an authority willing and able to enforce the rule.\n\nWith this understanding of Hart's distinction in mind, let's evaluate the answer choices:\n\n(A) It demonstrates the difference between the internal and the external aspect of a rule.\nThis choice focuses on the distinction between the rule of recognition (internal aspect) and the rules that are recognized and enforced by the legal system (external aspect). While this is a notable aspect of Hart's distinction, it does not fully capture the purpose of the distinction as explained in his philosophy.\n\n(B) It refutes the natural lawyer' view of the role of morality in law.\nHart's distinction does not directly address or refute the natural lawyer's view of morality's role in law. While Hart does believe that morality plays a role in the content of legal rules, his distinction is primarily concerned with the obligation to obey those rules, not the morality that underlies them.\n\n(C) It explains the nature of power-conferring rules.\nThis choice is the closest to the correct answer. Hart's distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation' helps explain the nature of power-conferring rules because it shows how secondary rules create obligations by enforcing rules with coercive power.\n\n(D) It illuminates the concept of a rule.\nHart's distinction does help illuminate the concept of a rule, but this answer choice is not the best explanation of the purpose of the distinction, as it focuses on only one aspect of his philosophy.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the best statement that explains the purpose of Hart's distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation' is:\n\n(C) It explains the nature of power-conferring rules.",

So, this could be the most probable reason.\n\n(B) His concept of status is misrepresented.\nWhile there may be some confusion about Maine's concept of status, this option is not very clear as to how it is misunderstood in regards to the aphorism. So, this option is less likely.\n\n(C) It is taken literally.\nThis option is also unclear as to how the aphorism is misunderstood when taken literally. So, this is also less likely.\n\n(D) His idea is considered inapplicable to Western legal systems.\nWhile there may be some debates about the applicability of Maine's ideas to Western legal systems, this option does not focus on the misunderstanding of the aphorism itself.

Natural law is a philosophical theory that certain rights are inherent by virtue of human nature, and can be understood through reason.\n\nTo determine the correct answer, let's evaluate each option in the context of the revival of natural law:\n\n(A) Depression of the 1930: This event occurred prior to any significant revival of natural law in the 20th century and is not directly related to the resurgence of the philosophy.\n\n(B) The rise of Fascism: Although Fascism did promote certain moral and social codes, it generally opposed natural law and individual rights, making this option unlikely.\n\n(C) The international recognition of human rights after World War II: This event occurred after the revival of natural law in the 20th century. While it may have been influenced by the philosophy, it is not the direct cause.\n\n(D) The Bolshevik Revolution: This event occurred prior to any significant revival of natural law in the 20th century and is not directly related to the resurgence of the philosophy.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, we can conclude that none of them directly contributed to the revival of natural law in the 20th century. However, if we must choose the option that is the least implausible, we could tentatively select (C) The international recognition of human rights after World War II.",

            "model_answer": "(C) It is misleading to pigeon-hole judges in this way.\n\nThis criticism is compelling because it questions the validity of Llewellyn's distinction between the grand and formal styles of legal reasoning. By suggesting that it is misleading to categorize judges in such a way, this criticism raises concerns about the accuracy and usefulness of the distinction. It highlights the possibility that the distinction may oversimplify the complex and nuanced process of legal reasoning, which could lead to misinterpretations and incorrect conclusions.",

This suggests that the POP would prioritize a compassionate society over wealth. So, this proposition is inconsistent with Rawls' view.\n\n(B) The POP will choose equality over power.\nRawls argues that the POP would choose principles of justice that maximize the welfare of the least well-off members of society. This suggests that they would prioritize equality over power. So, this proposition is consistent with Rawls' view.\n\n(C) The POP will be unselfish.\nWhile it is true that Rawls assumes the POP to be unselfish in their decision-making, this proposition does not address the specific issue of 'social primary goods.' Therefore, it does not answer the question as specifically as the other propositions.\n\n(D) The POP will choose to protect the disabled.\nRawls argues that the POP would choose principles of justice that protect the rights and interests of the most vulnerable members of society, including the disabled.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C). Max Weber solves the 'England problem' by distinguishing certain features of the English legal system that facilitated the development of capitalism.\n\nWeber's theory of the Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism suggests that certain religious and cultural factors, such as Calvinism, played a role in the development of modern capitalism. However, he also recognized that these factors alone were not sufficient to explain the rise of capitalism in particular places and times.\n\nIn his analysis of the English legal system, Weber identified several key features that he believed contributed to the development of capitalism. These included the system of common law, which provided a stable and predictable legal framework for economic activity; the development of the business corporation, which allowed for the accumulation of capital and the separation of ownership from management; and the availability of credit, which facilitated the growth of trade and industry.\n\nWeber also argued that the English legal system, with its emphasis on individual rights and the rule of law, created an environment that was conducive to economic activity and innovation. This, in turn, led to the development of a more rational and efficient mode of economic organization, as well as a greater degree of economic freedom for individuals.\n\nOverall, Weber's analysis of the English legal system provides a more comprehensive explanation for the development of capitalism than his earlier theory of the Protestant ethic alone. By identifying specific features of the legal system that facilitated economic growth, he was able to offer a more nuanced and detailed understanding of the relationship between culture, religion, and the rise of capitalism.",
