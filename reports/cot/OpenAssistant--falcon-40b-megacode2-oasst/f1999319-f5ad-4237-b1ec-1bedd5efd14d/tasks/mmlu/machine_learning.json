Support vectors are the data points that are closest to the decision boundary in the feature space and play a crucial role in determining the optimal hyperplane in SVM. The choice of kernel function (linear or higher order polynomial) can affect the representation of the data in the feature space and, in turn, impact the support vectors.

For example, if the parameter is a scalar, updating it will take O(1) time, regardless of the number of data points. If the parameter is a vector, updating it will take O(D) time, also regardless of the number of data points.\n\nSince we have the gradient of our cost function stored in a vector g, this means that our cost function depends on the model parameters in each element of g. Therefore, to update the model parameters, we need to perform an operation for each element of g, where the complexity of the operation depends on the number of data points (N) and the number of dimensions (D) of the corresponding parameter.\n\nSince we need to perform this operation for each element of the gradient vector g, we can estimate the cost of one gradient descent update as follows:\n\n|operation| * N * D\n\nwhere |operation| is the complexity of the operation needed to update the model parameters for each element of the gradient vector g.\n\nFor example, if the operation needed is to simply add a scalar to the parameter (e.g., learning rate times gradient), then the complexity will be O(1). If the operation needed is to update a scalar parameter with a division operation, then the complexity will be O(D).
