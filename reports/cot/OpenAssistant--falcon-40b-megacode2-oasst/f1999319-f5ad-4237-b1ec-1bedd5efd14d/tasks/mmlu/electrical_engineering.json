A centre zero galvanometer is connected in series with the potentiometer wire.\n\nWhen the potentiometer wire is adjusted so that the galvanometer shows zero deflection, the unknown voltage being measured can be read directly from the potentiometer scale.\n\nThis method is more accurate because the load imposed on the circuit by the potentiometer is less than that imposed by a voltmeter, and the use of a centre zero galvanometer allows for very precise measurements to be made.\n\nTherefore, the potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement is more accurate than direct measurement using a voltmeter because it uses a centre zero galvanometer instead of a voltmeter (option C).",

            "model_answer": "To determine which set of logic gates are designated as universal gates, we need to understand what universal gates are and their properties.\n\nA universal gate is a logic gate that can be used to create any other logic gate. In other words, if we have a universal gate, we can use it in combination with other gates to perform any logical operation.\n\nThere are four basic logic gates: NOT, AND, OR, and NOR. These gates can be used to create more complex gates, which in turn can be used to create even more complex gates. Ultimately, it can be shown that any logical operation can be performed using a combination of these basic gates.\n\nNow let's examine each set of logic gates:\n\n(A) NOR, NAND:\n- NOR is a negation of an OR operation.\n- NAND is a negation of an AND operation.\nThese two gates together can be used to create any other gate, including the basic gates (NOT, AND, OR, and NOR). Therefore, this set of gates is universal.\n\n(B) XOR, NOR, NAND:\n- XOR is an exclusive OR operation.\n- NOR is a negation of an OR operation.\n- NAND is a negation of an AND operation.\nThis set of gates can also be used to create any other gate, including the basic gates. Therefore, this set of gates is universal as well.\n\n(C) OR, NOT, AND:\n- OR is a logical disjunction (i.e., an operation that returns true if at least one of the inputs is true).\n- NOT is a logical negation (i.e., an operation that returns the opposite of its input).\n- AND is a logical conjunction (i.e., an operation that returns true only if both inputs are true).\nAlthough this set of gates can be used to create some basic gates, it cannot be used to create all the other gates, such as XOR and NAND. Therefore, this set of gates is not universal.\n\n(D) NOR, NAND, XNOR:\n- NOR is a negation of an OR operation.\n- NAND is a negation of an AND operation.\n- XNOR is an operation that returns true if the inputs are different, and false if the inputs are the same (the opposite of the XOR operation).\nThis set of gates can also be used to create any other gate, including the basic gates. Therefore, this set of gates is universal as well.\n\nBased on our analysis, the sets of logic gates designated as universal are:\n\n(A) NOR, NAND\n(B) XOR, NOR, NAND\n(C) OR, NOT, AND\n\nThe correct answer is a single letter surrounded by parentheses.

The firing angle is the angle between the voltage and current in a circuit.\n\nIn a single-phase one-pulse controlled circuit, the load voltage can be expressed as:\n\nV_load = E_load + V_dc\n\nwhere E_load is the load counter emf and V_dc is the DC voltage across the load.\n\nFor a load counter emf of 200 V, we can calculate the DC voltage across the load using the formula:\n\nV_dc = E_load / R\n\nwhere R is the circuit resistance.\n\nLet's assume R = 1 Ohm for simplicity. Then:\n\nV_dc = 200 / 1 = 200 V\n\nSince V_dc is the maximum voltage across the load, the firing angle must be less than or equal to 90 degrees (\u03c0/2 radians) for the circuit to operate properly.\n\nThus, the range of firing angle control is from 0 degrees to 90 degrees.

            "model_answer": "To find the electric field in the gap between two parallel metal plates, we can use Gauss's Law. Gauss's Law states that the electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the total charge enclosed by that surface.\n\nIn this case, the closed surface is a cylinder that runs along the gap between the two parallel plates. The electric flux through this cylinder is given by:\n\n\u03a6 = \u222e E \u00b7 dA\n\nwhere E is the electric field, dA is the differential area element, and \u222e is the integral taken over the surface of the cylinder.\n\nSince the plates are parallel, the electric field is constant across the gap, and we can choose any point on one plate to use as the origin for our cylinder. Let's choose a point on the left plate at a distance x from the midpoint of the plates. The differential area element dA can be written as:\n\ndA = r d\u03b8 * dz\n\nwhere r is the distance from the origin to the point on the plate, \u03b8 is the angle between the plate and a line perpendicular to it, and dz is the infinitesimal thickness of the plate.\n\nWe can then substitute this into the integral for the electric flux:\n\n\u03a6 = \u222b E \u00b7 (rd\u03b8 * dz) = \u222b (kq/2\u03c0r) * (rd\u03b8 * dz)\n\nwhere k is the Coulomb constant, q is the charge on the plate, and r is the distance from the origin to the point on the plate.\n\nNow, we can substitute in the expression for the electric field produced by one plate, which is given by:\n\nE = kq / (2\u03c0r)\n\ninto the integral:\n\n\u03a6 = \u222b (kq/2\u03c0r) * (rd\u03b8 * dz) = kq * r * (2\u03c0r) * d\u03b8 * dz\n\nSince the plates are infinite, the contribution from the thickness dz is zero. Additionally, we can perform the integral over the angle \u03b8 by using the fact that the plates are parallel, so the electric field is perpendicular to the plates. This means that d\u03b8 = 0, and we can simplify the integral to:\n\n\u03a6 = kq * r * (2\u03c0r) * d\u03b8 = 2\u03c0rkq * r\n\nFinally, we can compare this to the electric field produced by one plate, which we know is:\n\nE = kq / (2\u03c0r)\n\nDividing both sides by r gives us:\n\n\u03a6/E = (2\u03c0kq) / r\n\nSince \u03a6/E is a constant, we can choose any value of r and still have \u03a6/E be the same. This means that the electric field in the gap between the plates is independent of the position, and we can conclude that:\n\n(C) The electric field in the gap between the two parallel metal plates is dependent on coordinates of field points.",
