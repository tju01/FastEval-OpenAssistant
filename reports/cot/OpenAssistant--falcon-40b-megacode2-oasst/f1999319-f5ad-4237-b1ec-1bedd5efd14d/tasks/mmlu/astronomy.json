            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Let me evaluate each option step-by-step.\n\n(A) This type occurs in binary systems: Type-Ia supernovae are thought to result from a white dwarf in a binary system accreting matter from a companion star. When the white dwarf's mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit (around 1.4 solar masses), it undergoes a violent explosion, resulting in a type-Ia supernova. Hence, this option is true.\n\n(B) This type occurs in young galaxies: Type-Ia supernovae are thought to occur in galaxies of all ages, as long as they have enough old stars to create white dwarfs. Hence, this option is false.\n\n(C) This type produces gamma-ray bursts: Type-Ia supernovae are not typically associated with gamma-ray bursts. Gamma-ray bursts are thought to result from the collapse of very massive stars or the merger of neutron stars or black holes. Hence, this option is false.\n\n(D) This type produces high amounts of X-rays: Type-Ia supernovae are thought to produce large amounts of X-rays in the early stages after the explosion, but this emission fades over time. Other types of supernovae, such as core-collapse supernovae, are more strongly associated with high levels of X-ray emission. Hence, this option is false.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) This type occurs in binary systems.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Alright, let's go through this step-by-step:\n\nWe know the actual brightness of an object and its apparent brightness from your location.\n\nTo determine an object's apparent brightness, we use a concept called magnitude, which is a measure of how bright an astronomical object appears to an observer. Apparent brightness is the measure of an object's magnitude as seen by an observer, taking into account the distance to the object.\n\nWith this information, we can use the following formula to estimate the object's distance from us:\n\ndistance = (apparent brightness - actual brightness) / (5 * log10(distance_in_light_years))\n\nwhere distance_in_light_years is the distance to the object in light years.\n\nHowever, this formula only allows us to estimate the distance to the object, not its speed, composition, or size. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) Its distance from you",

            "question": "Why is the sky blue?\n\n(A) Because the molecules that compose the Earth's atmosphere have a blue-ish color.\n(B) Because the sky reflects the color of the Earth's oceans.\n(C) Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.\n(D) Because the Earth's atmosphere preferentially absorbs all other colors.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question we need to know a little bit about the nature of light and how it interacts with matter. Specifically, we need to know that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation, and that the properties of this radiation determine how it interacts with matter.\n\nWe know that light has both wave and particle properties, and that its behavior can be described by a set of equations known as Maxwell's equations. These equations tell us how electric and magnetic fields interact with each other and with charged particles, such as electrons.\n\nWe also know that the Earth's atmosphere is made up of a variety of gases, including nitrogen and oxygen, which are not themselves charged. However, these gases can still interact with light in a way that affects its behavior. This interaction occurs because the atoms and molecules in the atmosphere absorb and re-emit photons, which are packets of light energy.\n\nWhen sunlight reaches the Earth's atmosphere, it is made up of a range of colors or wavelengths, from short (blue) to long (red). Different gases in the atmosphere absorb different wavelengths of light more efficiently than others. For example, molecules of nitrogen and oxygen are particularly good at absorbing light in the blue and red parts of the spectrum.\n\nThis absorption and re-emission process causes the light traveling through the atmosphere to be scattered in all directions. However, shorter wavelengths (blue light) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (red light) because they are more easily absorbed by the gases in the atmosphere. This is known as Rayleigh scattering.\n\nSo, given the options provided, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.",

However, it is still not enough to prove the theory conclusively.\n\n(C) You can never prove your theory to be correct only \"yet to be proven wrong\": This statement is incorrect because scientific theories can be proven wrong or proven correct based on evidence and experimentation. The goal is to gather enough evidence to support or refute the theory.\n\n(D) When you and many others have tested the hypothesis: This is the correct answer because a scientific theory can be considered proven correct when multiple experiments and observations from different researchers show consistent results that support the hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

While Titan does have a thick atmosphere, it is not the only outer solar system moon with one. For example, Triton, which orbits Neptune, also has a significant atmosphere, primarily composed of nitrogen. So the answer is `(N)` for this statement.\n\n(B) Titan is the only outer solar system moon with evidence for recent geologic activity.\nThis is true. Titan is the only outer solar system moon for which evidence of recent geologic activity has been found. In particular, it is believed that liquid lakes and seas of liquid hydrocarbons, such as methane and ethane, may exist on Titan's surface. Furthermore, recent results from NASA's Cassini mission have suggested that Titan may have active dunes and even cryovolcanoes. So the answer is `(Y)` for this statement.\n\n(C) Titan's atmosphere is composed mostly of hydrocarbons.\nThis is true. Titan's atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen, with a significant amount of methane and other hydrocarbons. In fact, Titan's atmosphere is so rich in hydrocarbons that it is the only moon in the solar system with a significant atmosphere that is primarily composed of organic molecules.
