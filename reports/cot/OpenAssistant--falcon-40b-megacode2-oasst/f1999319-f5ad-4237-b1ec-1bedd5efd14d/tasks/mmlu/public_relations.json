Determine the scope of the problem: The contamination has affected a large number of consumers in the Albany, New York, market and has caused severe stomach cramps and other intestinal problems.\n\n2. Evaluate the potential risks: If the contamination is not addressed promptly, it has the potential to become a public relations disaster for the corporation and damage the brand's reputation.\n\n3. Contain the issue: In order to prevent the situation from getting worse, it is important to contain the issue as soon as possible. This means taking action to ensure that the contaminated product is no longer being sold.\n\n4. Investigate and take appropriate action: Once the scope of the problem is determined and the risks are evaluated, it is important to quickly investigate the cause of the contamination and take appropriate action to prevent it from happening again. This may include issuing a recall for the affected product.\n\nBased on these steps, the best course of action to recommend to the CEO would be:\n\n(B) Stop all sales of the product throughout the nation and issue a recall for that product.\n\nThis option addresses the issue quickly and effectively, and shows that the corporation is taking the matter seriously.

Hendrix (2002) introduced the \"Smart\" criteria for setting objectives. This model includes five criteria: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.\n\n2. Kendall (1999) proposed the \"EPO\" model for strategic planning. The model consists of three stages: Environmental Analysis, Problem Identification, and Opportunity Analysis.\n\n3. Merston (1963) developed the \"ORIENT\" framework for planning. It includes six steps: Objectives, Resources, Input, Execution, and Monitoring, and Tasks.\n\n4. Parkinson and Ekachai (2006) suggested the \"SWOT-analyse\" approach to planning. This model involves identifying the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats of a project or organization.\n\nNow, let's identify the common elements in these models:\n\n- Objectives: All models include setting objectives or determining goals for the planning process.\n- Implementation: All models have a stage or step related to implementing the plan or strategy.\n\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Objectives and implementation",
