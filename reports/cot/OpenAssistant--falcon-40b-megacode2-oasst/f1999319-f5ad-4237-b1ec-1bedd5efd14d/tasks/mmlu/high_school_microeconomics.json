            "model_answer": "To determine where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, we can use the concept of the marginal cost curve and the marginal revenue curve.\n\nThe marginal cost curve shows the additional cost of producing one more unit of a product. It slopes upward to the right because as more units are produced, fixed costs are spread over a larger number of units, causing the marginal cost to increase.\n\nThe marginal revenue curve shows the additional revenue generated by selling one more unit of a product. It slopes downward to the right because as more units are sold, the price per unit will generally decrease due to competition and/or reduced demand.\n\nThe point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost is the point where the marginal cost curve intersects the marginal revenue curve. This is the point where the slope of the marginal revenue curve is equal to the slope of the marginal cost curve.\n\nLet's now examine each of the options:\n\n(A) total revenue is greater than total cost at its greatest distance: This is not the correct answer because the question is asking for the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, not where total revenue is maximized.\n\n(B) total revenue is equal to total cost: This answer is incorrect because it corresponds to the point of maximized profit, not where marginal revenue equals marginal cost.\n\n(C) marginal product is at its highest point: This is not the correct answer because the question is asking for the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, not where the marginal product is maximized.\n\n(D) total product is at its highest point: This is not the correct answer because the question is asking for the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, not where the total product is maximized.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n(C) marginal revenue equals marginal cost",

            "model_answer": "1. We are given the marginal products of labor and capital. The marginal product of labor is 200, and the marginal product of capital is 50.\n\n2. We are also given the prices of labor and capital, which are $2 and $1, respectively.\n\n3. To find the optimal combination of labor and capital, we need to maximize the total product of labor and capital, subject to the constraints that the inputs must be non-negative.\n\n4. The total product of labor and capital is given by the following formula:\n\nTotal product = marginal product of labor * quantity of labor + marginal product of capital * quantity of capital\n\n5. Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\nTotal product = 200 * QL + 50 * QC\n\n6. We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraints that QL and QC are non-negative. We can do this by taking the derivative with respect to QL or QC and setting it equal to zero.\n\n7. Taking the derivative with respect to QL, we get:\n\n200 = QL + QC + 50\n\nQB = 0\n\n3QL + 2QC = 300\n\nQL = (300-2QC)/3 = 100-66Q/3\n\n8. Plugging this expression for QL into the total product expression from step 5, we get:\n\nTotal product = 200 * (100-66Q/3) + 50 * QC\n\n9. We want to maximize this expression, so we need to find the values of QC that correspond to the highest possible total product. To do this, we can set the derivative with respect to QC equal to zero and solve for QC:\n\n200 - 50Q = 66Q/3 - 50Q\n\nQD = 50Q/66\n\n10. Substituting this expression for QD into the derivative from step 9, we get:\n\n200 - 50Q + (50Q/66 - 50Q) = 66Q/3 - 50Q + (50Q/66 - 50Q)\n\n11. Simplifying, we get:\n\n200 = (38-2Q)/3\n\nQE = 38-2Q\n\n12. Plugging this expression for QE into the total product expression from step 5, we get:\n\nTotal product = (200 * (100-66Q/3)) + 50 * (38-2Q)\n\n13. We want to maximize this expression, so we need to find the values of (100-66Q/3) and 38-2Q that correspond to the highest possible total product. To do this, we can set the derivative with respect to each term equal to zero and solve for the corresponding expression:\n\nD(Total product w.r.t. (100-66Q/3)) = D(Total product w.r.t. (100-66Q/3)) = 200 - 66Q/3 - 50 = 0\n\nD(Total product w.r.t. (38-2Q)) = D(Total product w.r.t. (38-2Q)) = 200 * (100-66Q/3) - 50 * (38-2Q) = 0\n\nSolving the first equation for (100-66Q/3), we get:\n\n66Q/3 = 100\nQF = 100/66\n\nSubstituting this expression for QF into the second equation, we get:\n\n200 * (100-66Q/3) - 50 * (38-2Q) = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n200 * (30-66Q/3) = 50 * 36\n\n36Q/3 = 2000/50\n\nQG = 66/3\n\n14. Plugging these expressions for QF and QG into the optimal quantities from step 12, we get:\n\nOptimal quantities = (100-66QF/3), (38-2QG)\n\n15. Substituting the expressions for QF and QG, we get:\n\nOptimal quantities = (100 - (66/3)QF), (38 - 2(66/3)QG)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nOptimal quantities = (100 - 22QF), (38 - 2QG)\n\n16. We want to find the values of F and G that correspond to the highest possible total product. To do this, we can set the derivative with respect to F and G equal to zero and solve for F and G:\n\nD(Total product w.r.t. F) = D(Total product w.r.t. G) = 0\n\nSubstituting the expressions for QF and QG, we get:\n\nD(TP w.r.t. F) = 200 - 66QF - 50 = 0\nD(TP w.r.t. G) = 200 * (100 - 22QF) - 50 * QG = 0\n\nSolving the first equation for QF, we get:\n\n66QF = 200\nQH = 200/66\n\nSubstituting this expression for QH into the second equation, we get:\n\n200 * (100 - 22QF) - 50 * QG = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n200 * (78 - 44QF + 2QG) = 50 * 52\n\n52QF - 44QG + 78 = 2600\n\nQI = 44/2\n\n17. Substituting the expressions for QF, QG, and QI into the optimal quantities from step 14, we get:\n\nOptimal quantities = (100 - (66/3)QF), (38 - 2(66/3)QG), (52QF - 44QG + 78)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nOptimal quantities = (100 - 22QF), (38 - 2QG), (52QF - 44QG + 78)\n\n18.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what an oligopolist's demand curve looks like when rival firms follow a price decrease but not a price increase.\n\nAn oligopolist is a market structure where there are a few large firms that dominate the industry, and their decisions have a significant impact on the market. When rival firms follow a price decrease, it means that they have coordinated and made a decision to lower their prices. This situation creates a reaction from the oligopolist, who will then decide how to respond to this price decrease.\n\nIf the oligopolist decides to follow the price decrease, their demand curve will become more elastic because consumers have more options to buy from and will be more sensitive to price changes. If the oligopolist does not follow the price decrease and decides to keep their prices the same, their demand curve will remain relatively inelastic because consumers have fewer options to choose from and are less sensitive to price changes.\n\nHowever, if the oligopolist decides to increase their prices, their demand curve will become highly elastic because consumers will switch to rival firms' products, and the oligopolist will lose market share. In this situation, the oligopolist will face a significant decrease in demand.\n\nBased on this understanding, the answer to the question is:\n\n(C) Highly elastic demand curve.",
