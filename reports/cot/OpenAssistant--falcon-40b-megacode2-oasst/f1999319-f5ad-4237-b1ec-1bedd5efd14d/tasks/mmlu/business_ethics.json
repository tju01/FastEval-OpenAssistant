            "model_answer": "To solve this question, we must first identify which of the options best fits the spaces provided. Let's examine the possible answers:\n\n(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial\n(B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious\n(C) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial\n(D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious\n\nWe can eliminate the answer choices that have \"Safe practices\" in the first part because this contradicts the first point made about not encouraging safe practices. We are left with the following options:\n\n(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial\n(B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious\n(C) Unsafe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial\n(D) Unsafe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious\n\nThe third point made in the sentence states that the advertisement must not cause \"Trivial\" offence. This clues us into the correct answer.\n\n(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial fits the description.\n\nFurthermore, the use of the word \"typical\" in the sentence suggests that the answer should be on the more common or expected side. Out of all of the possible answers, the answer (A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial best fits the given criteria.\n\nTherefore the answer is: (A)",

They are not obligations that workers have towards their employer.\n\n(B) Employee rights (repeated): This is the same as option (A) and is therefore not the correct answer.\n\n(C) Employer duties: These are the obligations that employers have towards their employees, such as the duty to provide a safe workplace or to pay employees fairly. They are not the obligations of workers towards their employer.\n\n(D) Employee duties: These are the obligations that workers have towards their employer, based on individual contracts and wider employment laws.

Again, this term does not describe a ratio between work and non-work activities.\n\n(C) Work-play balance might imply a balance between work and leisure activities, but it's not a commonly used term and does not specifically refer to the ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities.\n\n(D) Work-life balance, on the other hand, refers to the idea of maintaining a balance between one's work and personal/family life, and is a commonly used term that specifically describes the ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) Work-life balance",

Sustainability thinking is mentioned, along with the consideration of companies and industries being bound together and interdependent due to resources and wastes.\n\nBased on these key points, the answer is:\n\n(B) Industrial ecosystems\n\nMy reasoning for this answer is that the question describes a system where companies and industries are interconnected and dependent on each other, similar to how organisms are interconnected and dependent on each other in an ecosystem. Additionally, the mention of resources and wastes further supports the idea that this is related to industrial ecosystems, as these are key components of industrial processes and waste management.",

The second part of the sentence also fits, as benefits can be unfairly distributed in such a situation. However, \"Hoodwinked\" does not fit as a limitation or risk specifically related to CSOs.\n\n- For option (B), the first part of the sentence fits, as a power imbalance can exist when one party has more resources than the other.

Profit maximization is a business strategy aimed at increasing a company's profits as much as possible. Among the options given, preference utilitarianism is the most similar to profit maximization because it focuses on fulfilling people's preferences, which can include their preference for a company to maximize profits.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) preference utilitarianism",
