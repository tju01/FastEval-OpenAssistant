            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's go through each option and analyze its relation to the establishment clause and free-exercise clause.\n\n(A) Freedom of speech is protected except in certain situations, such as yelling \"fire\" in a crowded theater.\nThis option is related to the First Amendment's freedom of speech clause, not the establishment clause or free-exercise clause. So, this option does not describe the balance between the two clauses we are looking for.\n\n(B) Once a church has been recognized by the federal government, its tax-exempt status can never be revoked.\nThis option refers to the tax-exempt status of churches, which is more related to the separation of church and state aspect of the establishment clause rather than the balance between the establishment clause and free-exercise clause. So, this option does not directly describe the balance either.\n\n(C) Once Congress has created an administrative agency, that agency can be dissolved only by a constitutional amendment.\nThis option is related to the principles of administrative law and the Constitution's separation of powers, not the balance between the establishment clause and free-exercise clause. So, this option does not describe the balance.\n\n(D) State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed.\nThis option refers to the separation of church and state, which is more related to the establishment clause. However, it also mentions voluntary prayer by student groups, which is related to the free-exercise clause. The Supreme Court has struck a balance between the two clauses by prohibiting state-sponsored religious activities but allowing voluntary religious activities by individuals or groups.\nSo, this option best describes the balance the Supreme Court has struck between the establishment clause and the free-exercise clause.\n\nThe answer is (D).",

            "model_answer": "Let's analyze each statement step-by-step and evaluate their accuracy in describing voting behavior in the United States.\n\n(A) According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in the 2016 presidential election, the voter turnout rate for citizens aged 45 to 64 was 71.4%, while the turnout rate for those under 21 was only 20.9%. Therefore, statement (A) appears to be accurate in describing voting behavior in the United States.\n\n(B) According to the National Center for Education Statistics, adults who have earned their GED are more likely to vote than those who have not completed high school. In the 2016 presidential election, the voter turnout rate for citizens with a high school diploma or higher was 66.2%, while the turnout rate for those without a high school diploma was only 31.8%. Therefore, statement (B) is inaccurate in describing voting behavior in the United States.\n\n(C) According to the Federal Election Commission, voter turnout in general elections has consistently been higher than voter turnout in primary elections. For example, in the 2020 presidential election, the general election had a voter turnout of 66.7%, while the primary election had a voter turnout of 30.8%. Therefore, statement (C) appears to be accurate in describing voting behavior in the United States.\n\n(D) According to the Center for American Women and Politics, women have made up a majority of the U.S. electorate in every presidential election since 1980. In the 2016 presidential election, women made up 53% of the electorate. Therefore, statement (D) is accurate in describing voting behavior in the United States.\n\nBased on our analysis, the statement that does NOT accurately describe voting behavior in the United States is:\n\nB",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we should consider the factors that have the most influence on a child's political views:\n\n(A) The geographical area in which the child grows up: This can influence a child's political views, as growing up in a particular region may expose the child to certain political ideas, values, and practices.\n\n(B) The child's family: The family is often the primary source of a child's political socialization. A child's parents, siblings, and other family members can have a significant impact on their political views by introducing them to certain political ideologies, discussing politics at home, and modeling political behaviors.\n\n(C) The media to which the child is exposed: Media, including television, radio, newspapers, and the internet, can play a significant role in shaping a child's political views. The media can introduce the child to different political perspectives, and frequent exposure to certain media outlets can reinforce particular political beliefs.\n\n(D) The child's religion: Religion can also play a role in forming a child's political views, particularly if the child's religion emphasizes certain political values or social issues.\n\nComparing these factors, we can see that while each plays a role in forming a child's political views, the family has the most direct and consistent influence. Therefore, the most significant factor in forming a child's political views is:\n\n(B) The child's family",

            "model_answer": "Federal judges are subject to the following disciplinary actions:\n\n(A) Impeachment, conviction, and removal from office by Congress - This is the correct answer because the U.S. Constitution allows for the impeachment and removal of federal judges, including those on the Supreme Court, by the House of Representatives and the Senate for \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\n\n(B) Removal from office by the appointing president - This is not entirely correct because while the president does have the power to remove federal judges, they must first be impeached by the House of Representatives and convicted by the Senate.\n\n(C) Removal from office by the president-elect - This is not correct because the president-elect does not have the power to remove federal judges. Only Congress has the power to impeach and remove judges.\n\n(D) Recall elections by citizens residing in the district over which the judge has jurisdiction - This is not correct because federal judges are not subject to recall elections.

            "model_answer": "Let me analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) The amount of coverage the issue receives in the major news media\n- Media coverage can influence public opinion and awareness of an issue. This could make an issue more or less salient depending on how much attention it receives. So, this could be a factor.\n\n(B) The degree to which public opinion on the issue is likely to shift quickly\n- A rapid shift in public opinion could make an issue more salient, since it would require attention and action. But it's not the only factor, and some issues may be important even if public opinion doesn't shift quickly.\n\n(C) The number of people affected by the issue\n- The number of people directly impacted by an issue can certainly make it more salient. However, it's not the only factor, and some issues may be important even if they don't affect a large number of people.\n\n(D) The importance of the issue to a particular individual or group\n- While the importance of an issue to a particular person or group can influence their actions and advocacy, it's not a defining factor for the salience of an issue as a whole.\n\nAfter analyzing all options, I would conclude that:\n\nThe answer is (A) The amount of coverage the issue receives in the major news media.

The case dealt with the appointment of William Marbury as a justice of the peace by the outgoing President John Adams, just before the end of his term.\n3. When Marbury sought his commission from the new Secretary of State, James Madison, he was denied due to the change in administration.\n4. Marbury then filed a writ of mandamus in the Supreme Court, seeking an order to compel Madison to deliver the commission.\n5. Chief Justice John Marshall, writing for the majority, ruled that Marbury had a right to the commission but that the remedy he sought, a writ of mandamus, was not available under the Judiciary Act of 1789.\n6. Marshall then went on to assert the court's power to review acts of Congress and determine their constitutionality, a power that had not been previously recognized.\n7. This decision established the principle of judicial review, which allows the Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of federal and state laws and declare them unconstitutional if they violate the Constitution.\n\nThe answer is (C) Judicial review.",
