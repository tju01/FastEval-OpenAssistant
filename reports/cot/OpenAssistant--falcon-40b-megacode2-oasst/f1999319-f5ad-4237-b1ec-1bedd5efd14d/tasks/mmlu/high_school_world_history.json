It also mentions that their revolutions will not be allowed to run their course, indicating that the passage is focused on the idea of self-determination and independence for Asia and Africa.\n\nThe speaker states that they can do much to promote peace and highlights the importance of reason, spirituality, morality, and political strength in achieving this goal. The reference to \"we, the peoples of Asia and Africa, 1.4 billion strong\" suggests that the passage is about a collective effort by these regions to promote peace and self-determination.\n\nConsidering these points, it becomes clear that the passage is most associated with the idea of the non-aligned movement, which was a collective effort by developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to promote peace and self-determination and resist the influence of the superpowers during the Cold War.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n(A) The formation of the non-aligned movement",

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out.

He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\u2014Adapted from U.S. Army Lt.

A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it.

British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin.
