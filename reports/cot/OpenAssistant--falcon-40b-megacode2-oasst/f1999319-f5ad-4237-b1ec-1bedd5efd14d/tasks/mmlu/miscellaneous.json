            "question": "In preparation for a writing unit on short stories, a teacher presents students with several examples of short stories and works with them to identify defining characteristics of the genre. Which of the following best describes this instructional strategy?\n\n(A) Conferencing\n(B) Discipline-based inquiry\n(C) Self-Regulated Strategy Development\n(D) Introduction-Body-Conclusion strategy",

            "model_answer": "To determine the best answer, let's analyze each option and see how it relates to the scenario provided:\n\n(A) Conferencing: This strategy involves one-on-one or small group discussions between a teacher and student(s) to provide feedback and guidance on their writing. While this could be a part of a writing unit, it doesn't fully capture the instructional strategy described in the scenario.\n\n(B) Discipline-based inquiry: This strategy involves students actively investigating and exploring content within a specific subject area. It doesn't specifically focus on short stories or writing, making it less relevant to the scenario.\n\n(C) Self-Regulated Strategy Development: This strategy involves teaching students techniques to independently monitor and regulate their thinking, behavior, and emotions during learning tasks. While it may be useful in a writing unit, it doesn't directly address the characteristics of short stories.\n\n(D) Introduction-Body-Conclusion strategy: This strategy involves teaching students to structure their writing by creating an introduction, body, and conclusion. While it could be part of a writing unit, it doesn't specifically focus on the defining characteristics of short stories.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, it seems that none of them fully capture the instructional strategy described in the scenario. However, out of the given choices, (B) Discipline-based inquiry comes the closest since it involves students actively investigating and exploring content within a specific subject area, which in this case is writing short stories. So, the answer is (B).",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The temperature at which paper burns is approximately 451 degrees Fahrenheit. This is a well-known fact and is often used as a reference point in literature, such as in Ray Bradbury's novel \"Fahrenheit 451.\"\n\nTo convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, we can use the following formula:\nFahrenheit (\u00b0F) = (Celsius (\u00b0C) \u00d7 9/5) + 32\nSo we can plug in 2125 degrees Celsius into the formula:\n\nFahrenheit (\u00b0F) = (2125\u00b0C \u00d7 9/5) + 32\nFahrenheit (\u00b0F) = (4250/5) + 32\nFahrenheit (\u00b0F) = 850 + 32\nFahrenheit (\u00b0F) = 882 degrees\n\nHowever, this temperature is higher than any of the given answer choices, so it must be a mistake in the conversion or in the question itself. Therefore, we can eliminate answer choice (C).\n\nFor the other answer choices:\n\nFahrenheit (\u00b0F) = (3985\u00b0C \u00d7 9/5) + 32\nFahrenheit (\u00b0F) = (7960/5) + 32\nFahrenheit (\u00b0F) = 1584 + 32\nFahrenheit (\u00b0F) = 1626 degrees\n\n1626 is not one of the answer choices, so this must also be a mistake in the question. Therefore, we can eliminate answer choice (D).\n\nFor the remaining answer choices:\n\nFahrenheit (\u00b0F) = (486\u00b0C \u00d7 9/5) + 32\nFahrenheit (\u00b0F) = (972/5) + 32\nFahrenheit (\u00b0F) = 195.6 + 32\nFahrenheit (\u00b0F) = 228 degrees\n\n228 is not one of the answer choices, so this must also be a mistake in the question. Therefore, we can eliminate answer choice (B).\n\nWe are left with answer choice (A):\n\nFahrenheit (\u00b0F) = (986\u00b0C \u00d7 9/5) + 32\nFahrenheit (\u00b0F) = (1972 / 5) + 32\nFahrenheit (\u00b0F) = 392 + 32\nFahrenheit (\u00b0F) = 424 degrees\n\nThis temperature is close to the given answer choices and is within a reasonable margin of error, taking into account possible rounding errors. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is:\n\n(A) 986 degrees",
