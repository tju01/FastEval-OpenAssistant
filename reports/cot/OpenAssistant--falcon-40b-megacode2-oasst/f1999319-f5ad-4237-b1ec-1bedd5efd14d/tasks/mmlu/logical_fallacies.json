In other words, the absence of evidence for one hypothesis does not automatically validate another hypothesis.\n\n(B) Double negative is a grammatical error and not a logical fallacy.\n\n(C) Equivocation occurs when a term is used with multiple meanings in an argument, often switching between these meanings in a way that leads to a false conclusion.
