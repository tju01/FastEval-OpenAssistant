            "question": "The weight of an aspirin tablet is 300 milligrams according to the bottle label. An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim.

            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we will use a hypothesis test for the mean of a normal distribution. We will assume that the population mean of the aspirin tablet weights is 300 milligrams (the manufacturer's claim), and we will use a significance level of 0.05.\n\nHere are the steps to calculate the P-value:\n\n1. Calculate the test statistic:\n\nt = (\u03a3 (x - 300)\u00b2)/\u03a3 (x - 300)\n\nwhere x = any of the sample weights, \u03a3 means summation, and the subscript '2' indicates that we are calculating the variance of the sample weights.\n\n2. Calculate the degrees of freedom (df):\n\ndf = n - 1\n\nwhere n = the sample size (number of tablets weighed)\n\n3. Look up the critical value of the test statistic in a standard normal distribution table for the appropriate significance level (\u03b1 = 0.05) and the number of degrees of freedom (df). The critical value determines the upper and lower tails of the distribution; if the calculated t-value falls within these tails, we reject the null hypothesis at the specified significance level.\n\n4. Calculate the P-value:\n\nP-value = 1 - P(t > critical value)\n\nwhere P(t > critical value) is the cumulative probability of the test statistic being greater than the critical value. This probability can be found in a standard normal distribution table or calculated using a statistical software package.\n\nLet's calculate the P-value for each of the given answer choices and compare them to the correct answer:\n\n(A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\nCalculate the degrees of freedom: df = 7 - 1 = 6\nLook up the critical value of the test statistic in a standard normal distribution table for \u03b1 = 0.05 and df = 6.\nThe critical value is t\u221e = 2.33.\n\nCalculate the cumulative probability of the test statistic being greater than 1.54:\nP(t > 1.54) = 1 - P(t < 1.54) = 1 - 0.9536 = 0.0464\n\nThus, the P-value is:\nP-value = 1 - P(t > 1.54) = 1 - 0.0464 = 0.9536 \u2248 0.95\n\n(B) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\nThe P-value is incorrect because it assumes that we are testing a hypothesis with a two-sided alternative hypothesis (\u03bc > 300 or \u03bc < 300), rather than the one-sided alternative hypothesis specified in the problem (\u03bc > 300).\n\n(C) P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\nThis choice appears to be an error since the number of degrees of freedom (df) should be 6, not 7. Therefore, we cannot calculate the P-value using this option.\n\n(D) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\nThis choice is also incorrect for the same reason as (B).\n\nBased on our calculations, the correct answer is\n\n(A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6",

We want to find the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders.\n\nFirst, let's find the z-score for the lower bound of the interval associated with 100,000 riders. We will use the formula:\n\nz-score = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere \u03bc is the mean (35 minutes) and \u03c3 is the standard deviation (10 minutes). We will use the lower bound of the interval, which is 31.7 minutes (from option B).\n\nz-score = (31.7 - 35) / 10 = -1.26\n\nSince we are looking for the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders, we need to find the upper bound of the interval. To do this, we will use the formula:\n\nP(x > \u03bc - z\u03c3) = 1 - P(x < \u03bc - z\u03c3) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\nwhere P(x > \u03bc - z\u03c3) is the cumulative probability of waiting times being greater than the lower bound of the interval and \u03bc is the mean. We will use the lower bound of the interval, which is 31.7 minutes.\n\n0.5 = 1 - P(x < 31.7 - 1.26 * 10) = 1 - P(x < 25.3)\n\nWe will now use the normal distribution table to find the corresponding cumulative probability:\n\nP(x < 25.3) = 0.1587\n\nSince this is greater than 0.5 - 0.0001 (10^-4), we can round to the nearest whole number and say that the lower bound of the interval associated with 100,000 riders is 0 to 31.7 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(A) 0 to 31.7 minutes",

Commonly used significance levels are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001. The smaller the significance level, the more stringent the test is.\n\nSo, if a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.
