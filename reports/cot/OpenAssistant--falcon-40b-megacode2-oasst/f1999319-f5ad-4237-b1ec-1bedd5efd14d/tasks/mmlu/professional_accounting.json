            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To calculate the yearly yield on your investment, we need to first find the total number of hours the limousine can be rented in a year and then calculate the total revenue from renting it. Finally, we can divide the total revenue by the initial investment to find the yearly yield.\n\nStep 1: Number of hours the limousine can be rented in a year\nThere are 365 days in a year, but we need to subtract the days when the car is not rented because of festivities and weekends. Let's assume there are 10 days when the car is not rented. So, the number of days the car can be rented in a year is 355. Since the car can be rented for 2 hours a day, the total number of hours it can be rented in a year is:\n355 days * 2 hours/day = 710 hours\n\nStep 2: Total revenue from renting the limousine\nThe car can be rented for $245 per hour. To find the total revenue, we need to multiply the number of hours it can be rented by the hourly rate:\n710 hours * $245/hour = $172,850\n\nStep 3: Yearly yield on investment\nTo find the yearly yield, we need to divide the total revenue by the initial investment. The initial investment was $98,000.\nYearly yield = Total revenue / Initial investment\nYearly yield = $172,850 / $98,000 = 1.7635\n\nSince we need to choose the answer from the given options, we can round the result to two decimal places to get 1.64%.\n\nSo, the answer is (B) 1.64%.",

This implies that the merchandise still has value.\n\n- Since the purchase was not recorded as an asset, it means that the value of the merchandise was not included in the total assets of the balance sheet. This would result in an understatement of the total assets.\n\n- Since the purchase was not recorded as a liability, there is no effect on the total liabilities of the balance sheet.\n\nTherefore, the effect of the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise had on Arno's balance sheet at year end is:\n\n(D) Understated Understated",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited.\n\nAn auditor generally performs the procedure of comparing the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited regarding subsequent events. This procedure is important because it helps the auditor identify any changes or updates that have occurred since the last financial statements were issued. By comparing the two sets of statements, the auditor can determine whether any of these changes have a significant impact on the financial statements being audited.\n\n(A) Inspecting inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end is not specifically related to subsequent events. This activity is more related to inventory management and may be performed by the auditor as part of their overall audit, but it is not a procedure specifically focused on subsequent events.\n\n(B) Testing internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate is an important part of the overall audit process, but it is not specifically related to subsequent events. This activity is aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the company's internal controls, which is a separate issue from subsequent events.\n\n(C) Reviewing the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end may be part of the overall audit process, but it is not specifically related to subsequent events. This activity is aimed at verifying the accuracy of the company's financial records, but it does not specifically address events that occur after the year end.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer the question, let's first determine the correct way to amortize the premium using the effective interest method.\n\nThe effective interest method calculates the interest on a bond using a constant rate, where the rate remains the same for the entire life of the bond. In this case, the bond has a 7-year maturity, so we'll use a 7-year constant rate to calculate the interest.\n\nLet's assume the face value of the bond is $1,000, the issue price is $1,050 (including the premium), and the effective interest rate is \"r.\"\n\nYear 1: Interest income = (Face value - Issue price) * r = ($1,000 - $1,050) * r = -$50\nSince the bond is issued at a premium, the beginning retained earnings will be negative.\n\nYear 2 and subsequent years: Interest income = (Face value - Accumulated retained earnings) * r = ($1,000 - Retained earnings) * r\nTotal interest income over 7 years = 7 * (Face value - Retained earnings) * r\nTotal bond proceeds = Issue price - Retained earnings = $1,050 - Retained earnings\nSince the bond is issued at a premium, the ending retained earnings will be negative as well.\n\nNow, let's see how the retained earnings, bond carrying value, and interest income are affected by Dean's error in using the straight-line method:\n\nRetained earnings: Under the straight-line method, the retained earnings are reduced by a constant amount each year, ignoring the premium. This will result in an understated retained earnings at the end of year 12.\n\nBond carrying value: The bond carrying value is the sum of the issue price and retained earnings. Since the retained earnings are understated under the straight-line method, the bond carrying value will also be understated.\n\nInterest income: Interest income will be overstated because the straight-line method ignores the premium, resulting in an artificial reduction of the bond's cost.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Overstated No effect",
