The given key suggests that we should use statements C and E.\n\nSo our goal is to prove the implication (if C and E are true, then D must be true).\n\nWe can start by supposing that E is true: then we know that Ashleigh stops by, so (~B \u2022 E) is false, so B must be true, so Izzy is playing Minecraft, which makes C true.\nSo if E is true, then it must be the case that D is true.\n\nLet's do the same for C: suppose that C is true, then we know that both (~B \u2022 E) and D must be false, which means that ~B \u2022 E is true, then B must be false, which means that Izzy is not playing Minecraft, which makes C true.\nSo if C is true, then it must be the case that D is false.\n\nBut we have just proved that if C is true and E is true, then it must be the case that D is true, and we also proved that if C is true it must be the case that D is false.
