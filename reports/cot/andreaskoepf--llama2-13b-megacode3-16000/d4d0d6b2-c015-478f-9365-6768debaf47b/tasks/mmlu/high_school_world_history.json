            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we first need to analyze the main points discussed in the passage by Indonesian leader Sukarno during the Bandung Conference in 1955. \n\n1. Sukarno emphasized the urgency of preserving peace and the significance of peace to Asian and African countries.\n2. The rehabilitation and upbuilding of countries in Asia and Africa will be difficult without peace.\n3. Revolutions in these countries will not have a chance to take place without peace.\n4. Sukarno then highlights the role of reason in world affairs and the need for Asia and Africa to mobilize their resources on the side of peace.\n5. Sukarno addresses the size and importance of the Asian and African population in this equation, emphasizing their unity and power.\n\nStep-by-step analysis of the options:\n\n(A) The formation of the non-aligned movement: The passage emphasizes the importance of peace and the need to unite Asia and Africa's strength against the need for a non-aligned movement. Sukarno's call for mobilizing Asian and African resources can be considered as a step in the formation of a non-aligned movement.\n\n(B) Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation: While the passage may indirectly support the notion of disarmament, it does not directly address the topic of nuclear weapons or the measures to reduce global nuclear arsenals.\n\n(C) The Green Revolution in agriculture: This topic is unrelated to the context of the passage, as it focuses on the political situation and the need for peace rather than on agriculture or development.\n\n(D) Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology: The passage does not describe any specific pan-Asian political or cultural ideology or call for unity based on shared interests.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning indicates that the passage is most closely associated with the formation of the non-aligned movement. Therefore, the answer is (A) the formation of the non-aligned movement.",

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze the content of each option and see how well they match the information provided in the passage.\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\nThe passage mentions that European governments found gunpowder weapons useful and spent resources on them. It also notes that China devoted its efforts to horse archer units in response to its main foe. Both examples show some aspects of technology and resource sharing, but the passage does not specifically address the sharing of technologies between states as a primary topic. The passage mainly focuses on the development of gunpowder weapons and the differing priorities of these countries based on their specific geopolitical situations.\n\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\nThe passage provides information on how European countries invested in gunpowder weapons and developed them for use, which contributed to their military capabilities at the time. It does not give an overview of European states' dominance over non-Western powers in the modern era.\n\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\nThe passage does not mention Silk Road commerce or its decline.\n\n\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion\nThe passage does not address the agricultural and economic conditions that allowed for cultural diffusion nor specifically the influence of the medieval climatic optimum.\n\nBased on the analysis, option (A) seems to have the closest connection to the information provided in the passage, as it discusses the development of gunpowder weapons and their impact on the strategic priorities and resource allocation of specific societies.",

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\u2014Adapted from U.S. Army Lt.

Bonesteel's concern was to establish a surrender zone as far north as the Soviets would accept while preventing them from seizing all of Korea. This implies the invoking of the 38th parallel as a hypothetical dividing line for the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender.\n\n2. The Americans wanted to prevent the Soviets from seizing all of Korea, indicating they had an interest in maintaining some level of control in the south.\n\n3. Since the focus of the event discussion is on the division of zones for surrender, rather than a complete takeover of Japan over Korea, it does not affect an immediate change in the governance of the peninsula.\n\n4. The collusion between American and Russian authorities preventing foreign interference in Chinese politics, in this case Russian control in North Korea, implies that there was some level of agreement between the three powers about maintaining the status quo. This means that Korea wouldn't be immediately unified under a common occupying force. \n\nFrom these steps, we have evaluated the provided options.\n\nWe can infer from this scenario that Bonesteel and the Americans were not explicitly seeking to unify Korea under a single rule or separate it unequivocally.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n(B) The Americans established freedom for all Koreans.",
