            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question\nThe question asks to determine which State has jurisdiction in relation to crimes committed on board vessels.\n\nStep 2: Define key terms\n(A) The coastal State: The State bordering the sea and/or land area where vessels navigate and has authority over navigable waters, coastal zones, or maritime boundaries.\n(B) Flag State: The State where a vessel is registered and has authority over the vessel with respect to the vessel's nationality and is responsible for the vessel's activities, but not strictly in regards to crimes committed on board.\n(C) Violates the question\nReviewing option C, this option contradicts the question, as it states that all states enjoy such jurisdiction, which might lead to possibilities of double jeopardy.\n\nStep 3: Analyze remaining options\nNow let's analyze options (A) and (B):\n(A) The coastal State: As mentioned earlier, the coastal State has authority over the sea, land area, navigable waters, and maritime boundaries, which may influence crime jurisdiction in certain cases.\n(B) The flag State: The flag State has authority over the vessel's nationality and the vessel's activities, but this privilege does not cover all issues, such as crimes committed on board by people not operating the vessel.\n\nStep 4: Determine the best answer\nIt is clear that the coastal State's authority over navigable waters plays a significant role in jurisdiction since the crimes might be related to navigable waters and ports, exclusive economic zones, or in some cases, territorial waters. While the flag State may have some jurisdiction over the vessel's activities, it does not directly address crimes committed by anyone on board.\n\nTherefore, the State that exerts jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels is:\n\nThe (A) The coastal State",

            "model_answer": "To determine the correct meaning of justiciability, we can start by analyzing the provided options step-by-step:\n\nA) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders.\nThis option focuses on the ability of individuals to enforce their specific rights themselves, making it a possibility-focused definition.\n\nB) Justiciability refers to the just nature or cause of a particular right.\nThis option refers to the qualities or standards that a right may possess, rather than defining the enforcement or non-enforcement aspects of a right.\n\nC) Justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular rights conforms to principles of justice.\nThis option focuses on the measurement of justice in relation to the non-enforcement of a right, looking at whether it adheres to fairness and equality.\n\nD) Justiciability refers to the obligation of a State to enforce a particular Right.\nThis option centers on the responsibility of a government or sovereign authority to ensure specific rights' enforcement, typically through the judicial system.\n\nUpon analyzing these explanations, we notice that the term \"justiciability\" has a better connection with options D and C. Option D is related to the State's obligation to enforce rights, while option C is about the court's role in assessing non-enforcement and adherence to justice. However, option D specifically discussion about the State's obligation, making it the most accurate definition.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nD) Justiciability refers to the obligation of a State to enforce a particular Right.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question step-by-step, we will first determine the main differences between Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and humanitarian intervention. Let's break down the elements of each concept:\n\n1. R2P is a responsibility of the international community towards protected individuals facing mass atrocities and human rights abuses, whereas humanitarian intervention refers to actions taken by others to address humanitarian crises such as famines, natural disasters, or conflicts without the specific purpose of preventing mass atrocities.\n2. R2P focuses on situations where protective forces are needed to prevent atrocities, while humanitarian interventions mainly aimed at providing assistance to victims once the crisis has started.\n3. R2P requires a call for assistance from the State in distress, while humanitarian interventions can be initiated by the UN or any group with a genuine concern for the affected population.\n4. R2P includes a legally binding, international norm that mandates countries and the UN to prevent mass atrocities, while humanitarian interventions have largely been based on a set of guidelines and principles encouraged by the UN, which are not legally binding for individual countries.\n5. R2P allows the use of force to intervene, whereas humanitarian interventions are primarily non-military in nature, relying on peacekeeping and humanitarian aid.\n\nFrom the comparison above, we can deduce that:\n\n(A) R2P is NOT essentially the same as humanitarian intervention, as they have different objectives, principles, and mechanisms.\n\n(B) R2P does require a call for assistance by the State in distress, making the two procedures distinct.\n\n(C) R2P is indeed less arbitrary compared to humanitarian intervention, as it is a legal, norm-based framework with a well-defined set of objectives, and it requires some involvement of the UN Security Council. On the other hand, humanitarian intervention is based on guidelines and principles, which are not as legally binding and have no direct influence from the UN Security Council.\n\n(D) R2P is NOT always accompanied by armed force, as, though it does allow the use of force in limited circumstances, humanitarian interventions generally involve non-military actions (peacekeeping and humanitarian aid) in response to emergencies or crises.\n\nConsidering the justifications above, the answer is:\n\n(C) enclosed in parentheses: (C)",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources.\n\nThe UK Constitution at its core is uncodified, which means it is not a single document outlining specific Articles or Statutes that define its structure, but rather it consists of several sources and traditions. These sources together form the British Constitution.\n\nThis system can be understood through the following reasoning:\n\nA) The main focus of the UK Constitution is the balance of power between the executive, legislature, and judiciary. The monarchy, as it were, has not been able to assert itself as the exclusive source of authority and power, as mentioned. Therefore, this option is not accurate.\n\nB) On the other hand, although the UK judiciary, especially the Supreme Court, has the power to strike down legislation that conflicts with what is established in law or slots against the principles of the parliament, they cannot \"overturn\" per se any act of parliament. To some extent, this option partially true but with a vital condition that the act must be in line with the Parliamentary laws, Acts of Parliament, or the Human Rights Act.\n\nC) As fluctuating set of traditions, conventions, rules, rules of court, and laws that are created through acts of parliament and other documents (such as those detailing the legal basis for the monarchy, Commons, Lords, and Judiciary), the UK constitution may be seen as being composed of multiple sources. These sources include the Fundamental Laws, primarily the Magna Carta, which limits the power of the royal prerogative, thefact that the United Kingdom has a constitutional monarchy with a Westminster-style cabinet-led parliamentary democratic system, and the influence from the European Union and its treaties. \n\nSo, the final answer that best describes the UK Constitution is (C) The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources. This option recognizes that the UK Constitution can be found in a multitude of sources and is not solelydistilled in one single document.",

This does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes.\n\nThe obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes in international law is rooted in Article 2, paragraph 3 of the United Nations Charter, which encourages members to settle their disputes peacefully. It does not impose a strict obligation on States to resolve their disputes, but rather an obligation to make efforts towards peaceful settlement. This commitment to resolving disputes peacefully contributes to international peace and stability. States are not advised to use force or coercion, and instead need to resort to alternative means including dialogue, negotiation, mediation, arbitration, and conciliation. As such, while the obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes exists, it does not guarantee that disputes will be resolved in every case.",

Protocol 14 indeed changed the composition of the admissibility committees. Instead of a three-judge formation, it establishes a one-judge absence for the European Court of Human Rights.\n\n(B) Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility.\n- This statement is true as well. Protocol 14 amended Article 35 of the European Convention on Human Rights, adding a new criterion for admissibility cases. This criterion states that the Court can reject applications based on certain time limits.\n\n(C) Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights.\n- This statement is false. Protocol 14 did not abolish the Commission of Human Rights. On the contrary, it established the Court's power to find violations against the states when the Commission was unable to do so.\n\n(D) Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights.\n- This statement is also false. Protocol 14 did not extend the mandate for European Court of Human Rights judges.

While it is a mechanism that relates to human rights, the UPR itself is not a treaty, so this option is not correct.\n\n(D) The UN special mandates: This option refers to various UN roles tasked with monitoring and reporting on specific human rights concerns within states or addressing particular issues, such as the Special Rapporteur on torture or the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief.
