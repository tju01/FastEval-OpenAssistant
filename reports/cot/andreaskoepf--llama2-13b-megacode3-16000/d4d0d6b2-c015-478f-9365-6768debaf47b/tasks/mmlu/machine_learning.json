            "model_answer": "Statement 1: Linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.\n\nTo answer this statement, we need to determine if the variance of the linear regression estimator is smaller than the variance of other unbiased estimators. Here, we are asked to compare the variance of the linear regression estimator with the variance of other unbiased estimators.\n\nIn general, for any linear model, the variance of the linear regression estimator will be smaller than or equal to zero, as the linear model ensures that the coefficient of determination (R^2) is always within the range [0, 1]. All unbiased estimators cannot exceed the maximum possible variance (0), and therefore, the variance of the linear regression estimator will be the smallest among them when their unbiased estimates are included.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) True.\n\nStatement 2: The coefficients assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\n\nIn order to determine if the coefficients assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative, we need to understand the AdaBoost algorithm and its principle. AdaBoost is an oversampling technique that is used for binary classification tasks. It forms a classifier by iteratively learning a weak learner and then combining the learner with the previous classifiers in increasing order of their error.\n\nAdaBoost works by iteratively fitting a weak learner multiple times. Within each iteration, the algorithm randomly selects examples that the classifier doesn't predict correctly and weights them inversely proportional to the misclassification error of the weak learner in the current iteration. Since the algorithm strives to minimize the overall loss, it will assign non-negative coefficients to the chosen examples, even when the examples have negative error.\n\nHowever, the weights assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost at the beginning of each iteration need not be non-negative unless the previous assembling process ended up with classifiers that already achieved $100%$ accuracy. When the accuracy improves within each iteration, some coefficients might become negative, but the non-negative weight assigned before ensures that the overall function remains concave upward.\n\nSo, the answer is (B) False.",

Let's analyze them one by one:\n\n(A) Convolutional Networks:\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are designed specifically for image analysis tasks, including classification, segmentation, and object detection. They are highly effective for high-resolution image classification. By using biologically inspired architecture and pooling operations like max-pooling, CNNs can effectively process large amounts of pixel data and extract relevant features. They have seen great success in various vision tasks, like image classification and object detection, making them an established choice for high-resolution image classification.\n\n(B) Graph Networks:\nGraph Networks are used for solving problems related to graph data. They process data where each data point is represented as a node and connected to other nodes based on relationships between them. They can also be used for image analysis, but their primary focus is on analyzing Structured Data. While graph networks can be useful for some image-related tasks, they do not specialize in classifying high-resolution images specifically, making them a less optimal choice compared to CNNs.\n\n(C) Fully Connected Networks:\nFully Connected Networks are those where all nodes in the network are connected to all other nodes. This structure allows the network to synergistically combine the strengths of each node, applying input from every node to every other node. They do not exploit spatial information between adjacent pixels as effectively as CNNs. They are generally less successful in high-resolution image classification compared to CNNs.\n\n(D) RBF Networks:\nRadial Basis Function (RBF) Networks are a type of artificial neural network using a kernel function to transform the input data. These networks can be used for various machine learning tasks, including image analysis. However, RBF networks are not as popular and well-documented as CNNs and can be less efficient at solving image classification problems compared to CNNs.\n\nConsidering all the advantages and disadvantages outlined above, the best architecture for classifying high-resolution images as of 2020 is:\n\n(A) convolutional networks",

The log-likelihood of the data can decrease during the expectation maximization algorithm if the current model is poorly fitted to the data. This is because when we fit a model using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), we are adjusting the parameters of the model to make it fit the data as closely as possible. This gets rid of the previously observed likelihood value which was established, and in doing so, it minimizes the log-likelihood function.\n\nStatement 2: \"One disadvantage of Q-learning is that it can only be used when the learner has prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment.\"\n\nThis statement is true. Q-learning is an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm and its performance relies on the agent's knowledge of its environment and behavior. It uses the Q-table to store the estimated values of the state-action tuples learnt through experience in the environment and updates them sequentially through iterative majorization-minimization algorithm. Without prior knowledge about its environment, the agent can't make an efficient use of the Q-table and lead to inefficient behavior.\n\nSo, based on the statements, the correct answer is: \n(B) False, False",

Training examples: Training examples in the context of machine learning refer to the input data that is used to train a model. The model is trained to analyze this data and learn to make accurate predictions or classifications on new, unseen data.\n\n2. Variance: Variance in machine learning refers to the measure of how much the output values vary for a given set of input data. A smaller variance indicates that the outputs cluster closely together, while a larger variance indicates that the outputs are more spread out.\n\n3. Machine Learning Model Stability: Generally, as the number of training examples increases, the model's ability to capture the patterns in the data increases, thereby leading to better generalization and improved prediction performance.
