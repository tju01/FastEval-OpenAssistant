            "model_answer": "To find the degree of the given field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q, we need to understand what it means to obtain an extension field. \n\nA field extension is defined as a consistent extension of a base field, meaning that the extension must contain all the elements of the base field and be closed under the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In other words, the extension must be a subfield of the extension field itself.\n\nIn our problem, the given field is Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)), which means it is a subfield of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)), and it is contained in the same underlying field, which is R.\n\nNow let's recall the degrees of the basic expansions:\n- The degree of Q over R has degree 1, which is the number of elements in each algebraically independent set.\n- The degree of R over Q has degree 1, where R = Q(sqrt(3)).\n\nTo answer the question, we need to determine the degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q(sqrt(3)). \n\nSince we know that the common part is Q(sqrt(3)), we can find the difference of their degrees as follows:\n\nDegree(Q) - Degree(Q(sqrt(3))) = Degree(Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)))\n\nFrom the given degrees above, the formula becomes: \n1 - 1 = Degree(Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)))\n\nNoting that Q(sqrt(3)) is a subfield of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)), we can conclude that the degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) must be equal to the number of elements that are not in Q(sqrt(3)). Since there are two elements in the extension that are not in Q(sqrt(3)) (namely sqrt(2) and sqrt(18)), the degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is:\n\nDegree(Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18))) = 2\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) 2.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's look at each statement and evaluate its truth separately.\n\nStatement 1: A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian. \n\nA factor group is formed by dividing a larger group (let's call it H) into separate commuting classes. Commuting classes are sets of elements that commute with each other. Commuting elements mean that (ab) = (ba) for every pair of elements a, b in the commuting class. Let the factor groups be formed from non-commuting elements, that is, where (ab) \u2260 (ba). This means that in every pair of elements a and b in the commuting class, they are mutually annihilated by each other. This isn't possible except if they're equal to each other (i.e., a = b).\n\nNon-Abelian groups are defined as groups where the multiplication operation is not commutative, which means that the product of two elements doesn't necessarily give the same result when the order of the operation changes. Consequently, a non-Abelian group can't have two members commuting with each other, because they cannot satisfy the definition of a commuting class in the above equation.\n\nSo, since a factor group is formed by dividing the non-Abelian group into commuting classes and a non-Abelian group cannot have commuting elements, a factor group of a non-Abelian group must be non-Abelian as well.\n\nStatement 2: If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nIf H is a normal subgroup of G, it means that the commutator [H,G] has a size of 1 (ab= ba =e) for all elements a and b in H or a and b in G. This implies that the operation of H on G is homographically equivalent with the operation of a subgroup of G on itself (that is, [H,G]=1 implies aH[G]b=G)).\n\nNow, if K is a normal subgroup of G, then K is both a normal subgroup of H (since K is a normal subgroup of G and G is a normal subgroup of H) and H is also a normal subgroup of G ([H,G]=1). Hence, there will be a homographically equivalent group of K on G itself (aK[G]Kb=K) which implies that K is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is True.

So, the hypothesis becomes that a group with 9 elements of order 15 and only 9 elements in total is true.\n(b) If the group has more than 9 elements of order 15, then the statement finally become true.\n\nSo, the hypothesis follows that every group with 9 elements has more elements of order 15, or are not following the hypothesis.
