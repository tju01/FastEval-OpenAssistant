            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "First, let's determine the total revenue from daily rentals.\n\nYou bought the limousine for $98,000, which relates to the cost of the limousine. I will set this value aside for now and focus on the rental income.\n\nTo calculate the rental income, we need to find the number of hired hours and multiply it by the hourly rate.\n\nYou mentioned that the limousine will typically be hired for 2 hours a day, but you also said that you'll be accounting for all days of the year (including festivities and weekends). So, let's assume the limousine is completely utilized every day.\n\nTo calculate the total hours of rental revenue, we can multiply the daily hire time by the number of days per year (including festivities and weekends). There are 365 days in a year, and we'll assume 252 weekends in a year (divided by 2).\n\nTotal Hours = 2 hires/day * 365 days + 252 weekends = 1598 Hours\n\nWe know the hourly rate is $245, so to calculate the rental yield, we need to multiply the total hiring hours by the hourly rate.\n\nRental Yield = Total Hours * Hourly Rate\n\nRental Yield = 1598 Hours * $245/hour\n\nRental Yield \u2248 $380,117\n\nNow let's calculate the net yield by subtracting the original cost of the limousine from the rental yield.\n\nNet Yield = RentalYield - Cost\n\nNet Yield = $380,117 - $98,000\n\nNet Yield = $282,117\n\nNow, divide the net yield by the initial cost of the limousine to find the yield percentage:\n\nYield Percentage = Net Yield / Initial Cost\n\nYield Percentage = $282,117 / $98,000 = 2.86 or 286/100\n\nNext, please check your answer against the given options:\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%\n\nWe see that the yield percentage for option (A) is closest to what we calculated, which is approximately 2.86%. Therefore, the answer is (A) 164%.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the effect of the omitted credit purchase on Arno's balance sheet at year-end, we will analyze the potential impacts on assets and liabilities separately.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the effect on assets\nThe main focus in an inventory-costing company for year-end is to ensure all goods are accurately valued on the balance sheet. The cost of goods sold is then directly affected by the cost of goods available, which in turn will affect profitability and other figures derived from the financial statements. \n\nIn this case, Arno did not record the credit purchase of merchandise, meaning it has not been recorded as an asset on the balance sheet. This results in assets being understated.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the effect on liabilities\nArno did not record the expense of the credit purchase for merchandise either, which amounts to accrued but unpaid expenses for the goods. Therefore, this amount is not recorded as a liability on the balance sheet either. The absence of these expenses effectively reduces liabilities.\n\nStep 3: Determine the net effect on the balance sheet\nGiven the information about the omitted items, we attribute them to their respective financial statement elements (assets or liabilities):\n\n- Assets: Understated\n- Liabilities: Reduced\n\nIn this case, the omitted purchase of merchandise understated assets while reducing liabilities, resulting in an overall reduction in total liabilities. Therefore, the net effect on the balance sheet is understated.\n\nThe answer is (D) Understated Understated.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct statement about audit sampling risks for a nonissuer is:\n\n(A) Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\n\nTo reach this conclusion, let us analyze the four statements one by one:\n\n(A) This statement is consistent with the concept of nonsampling risk. It clearly states that when auditors rely on a sample rather than performing an audit on each element in the population, there is a possibility that incorrect conclusions may be drawn about the population as a whole. This is because the results obtained from a sample can vary to some extent from the entirety of the population.\n\n(B) This statement addresses the generally known issue of professional skepticism or auditor discretion, which is an essential element of audit quality. Nevertheless, it is not directly related to the concept of sampling risks. The risk of an auditor failing to recognize misstatements is not what is inherently risky about sampling in an audit.\n\n(C) Sampling risk, also known as sampling error, is not directly related to a nonissuer. Sampling risk quantifies the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to a specific risk. Sampling error may occur due to the auditor's chance assessment regarding the items on which the tests are applied, thus affecting the accuracy and validity of the audit results.\n\n(D) This statement refers to the optimization of audit procedures, which is not the direct risk associated with audit sampling. Implementing improper or inefficient audit procedures that do not align with the objective of the audit can indeed pose risks. However, these are known as planning and implementation risks rather than sampling risks itself.\n\nFollowing the analysis of the statements and justifying the reasoning, the answer is step-by-step correct for a nonissuer; i.e., (A) Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's examine each procedure step-by-step and check if it relates to a subsequent event (events that occur after the end of the audit period).\n\n(A) Inspect inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end:\nInventory inspection is a process of ensuring that the inventory records reflect the actual quantity available. Inspecting items that arrived after the year end may not be related to subsequent events, as they are part of the year-end financial statements, not occurring after the year end.\n\n(B) Test internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate:\nTesting internal controls is a standard procedure for an auditor to check if internal controls are effectively preventing and detecting errors and fraud. Testing internal controls that were previously reported to management as inadequate would not fall under subsequent events since this activity is part of their ongoing audit and was previously reported to management.\n\n(C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end:\nReviewing cutoff bank statements after the year-end is essential to verify that all transactions up to the balance sheet date are recorded and properly audited. This procedure is crucial for an auditor to confirm that the financial statements are accurate and complete. This activity occurs within the audit period and can extend beyond the year end. Therefore, it is directly related to subsequent events.\n\n(D) Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited:\nThis procedure would generally occur during the audit and compare the interim statements with the following audited period's statements. It can help answer any potential concerns that may affect the financial statements being audited, as well as assess for any unrecorded significant events. Again, this activity is part of their ongoing audit process.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the answer to the question should be (C). An auditor would generally perform reviewing the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end regarding subsequent events as it is related to verifying that all transactions up to the balance sheet date are recorded and properly audited.",

            "model_answer": "To answer the question, we must first understand the role of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in relation to the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). The ASC is a comprehensive, topical, and numeric compendium of accounting and reporting standards that FASB, along with other US standards-setting organizations, prepare.\n\nNext, let's review the four options and understand their functions:\n\n(A) Accounting Standards Updates (resource: FASB.org): These are official updates made by the FASB to the ASC, usually in response to developments in accounting practices, changes in the financial reporting requirements, or to clarify accounting standards and concepts. They are organized in the form of a list followed by discussion of each update.\n\n(B) Emerging Issues Task Force Releases (resource: FASB.org): Also authored by the FASB, these are more focused on emerging issues related to accounting,reporting, and financialmarkets. They highlight areas that need improvement and propose paths for organizational change.\n\n(C) Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (resource: FASB.org): These are authoritative sets of rules that define the specific accounting principles, standards, and other requirements for preparing and presenting financial statements for a variety of corporate entities. They are organized as individual publications that cover a specific subject matter or address a particular financial reporting problem.\n\n(D) Staff Technical Bulletins (resource: FASB.org): These are the informal interpretations and clarifications provided by the FASB staff in response to specific questions or information requests from users of the ASC. They address issues that may not have been specifically covered or clarified in ASC throwers or in FASB statements.\n\nNow that we understand the roles of each choice, let's select the one that aligns with the task of the FASB regarding Accounting Standards Codification.\n\nSteps:\n1. Identify which option is related to an iterative process of updating and maintaining the ASC.\n2. Confirm that it is more formal than the other options (i.e., more relevant to formal accounting standards and less likely to be informal staff interpretations).\n\nAnswer and reasoning:\nThe FASB makes changes to the Accounting Standards Codification by issuing\n(A) Accounting Standards Updates.\n\nThis is because the ASC is updated frequently, and the primary objective of ASC Updates is to keep the ASC current and reflect the changes in accounting practices and financial reporting requirements. The ASC Updates provide thorough analysis of the relevance of these changes and outlines the modifications needed to the ASC to address them. Other options like Emerging Issues Task Force Releases, Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, and Staff Technical Bulletins do not directly address the process of the FASB updating and maintaining the ASC.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer the question, let's go through the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. Understand the problem: Dean Co. issued bonds with a premium and used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method to amortize the premium. This causes a difference in the carrying value of the bonds since the effective interest method gives a more accurate amortization schedule.\n\n2. Accuracy of interest calculation: The effective interest method generally results in better-aligned carrying values over time than the straight-line method, as it accounts for any remaining accrued interest after payments. However, in this context, since Dean used the straight-line method, the carrying value would most likely be overstated.\n\n3. Carrying amount at June 30: At the end of the bonds' life, the carrying amount should be the same as the face value, but if Dean used the straight-line method, there would still be a premium (the excess of the carrying amount over the face value) that would not have been subtracted from the carrying amount. That premium represents interest that Dean has already earned but not recorded as expense.\n\n4. Create the options and justify them:\n\n(A) Overstated: Since the straight-line method led to overstating the carrying amount of the bonds throughout the life of the bonds, Jan. 30, year 12, the retaining amount would not accurately reflect the company's earnings as understated (Option B is incorrect).\n\n(B) Understated: This answer does not consider the premium. The carrying amount is above the face value because the premium represents interest accumulated but not recorded as expense. Overstating the carrying amount doesn't affect earnings. Therefore, earnings would not be understated.\n\n(C) Overstated No effect: Since the carrying amount is overstated due to the use of the straight-line method, this equation would be true. Since Jan. 30, year 12, accounts balance would still show the carrying amount including the premium, thus affecting the ledger. Followed by (D) 'No effect No effect', year 7's retained earnings would not be affected by the overstated carrying amount as what has happened on Jan. 30, year 12, in year 7.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) Overstated No effect.",

During a tax year, the corporation reported $400,000 in taxable income and distributed a total of $70,000 in cash dividends to its shareholders. Carson accurately reported $28,000 in gross income on Carson\u2019s individual tax return. If the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions to the owners had been proportionate, how much income would Carson have reported on Carson\u2019s individual return?\n\n(A) $28,000\n(B) $132,000\n(C) $160,000\n(D) $188,000",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Let's solve this problem step-by-step.\n\n1. Calculate Carson's distributive share of the $70,000 cash dividends. Since Carson owns 40% of the outstanding stock, we can calculate his share by multiplying the total distributable dividends ($70,000) by his ownership percentage (40%).\n\nCarson's share of the dividends = 0.4 * $70,000 = $28,000\n\n2. Calculate the taxable income of the corporation using the formula, Taxable income = Gross income - Tax distribution (Hence, we can figure out the tax distribution directly from each individual's share of taxable income. We will need to calculate each person's expected tax distribution based on their share of taxable income, and then sum them all up to find the total tax distribution for the company).\n\nTotal tax distribution = Tax distributed to Carson + Tax distributed to other shareholders\nTotal tax distribution = $28,000 + Tax distributed to the rest of the owners\n\n3. Carson accurately reported $28,000 on his individual return. Since he obtained this amount, he funded the corporation's tax payment, which is why Carson doesn't need to report this as income twice in his individual return. So our assumption is that his tax distribution is $0 (which means he paid all corporation's taxes).\n\n4. Total tax distribution = $28,000\n\n5. Based on his total dividends, his distributive share of the taxable income is as follows:\nTaxable income = $70,000 - $28,000 = $42,000\n\n6. Now, we'll need to find the company's marginal tax rate on this additional taxable income. From this year\u2019s tax table, we can see that the corporate tax rate is 21%.\n\nTax rate = 21%\n\n7. Finally, we can calculate the tax paid by the company on Carson's distributive share:\nTax payment = 21%*($42,000) = $8,620\n\n8. Now we can assume that what the corporation distributed to Carson would be 100% deductible for corporate tax purposes (in reality, it might be only partly deductible).\n\nTotal tax-free distribution to shareholders (including Carson) = Cash dividends + Non-cash distributions (equity) = $70,000 + ?\n\n9. To figure out the non-cash distribution (equity), we can use the following equation:\nTotal tax-free distribution = cash + non-cash (equity) distribution\n\nCarson's equity\nCarson's equity = $70,000 * 40% = $28,000\n\nSo, non-cash distribution (equity) to shareholders = $70,000 - $28,000 = $42,000 (equal to taxable income)\n\n10. Now that we have the non-cash distribution (equity) to all the shareholders, we can find out what Carson would report on his individual return.\nCarson's expected tax distribution = ($28,000) + ($28,000) = $56,000\n\n11. Since Carson paid for the company's taxes ($8,620), he would subtract this from his expected tax distribution($56,000) to find his individual tax liability; making $56,000 - $8,620 = $47,380.\n\n12. From a tax perspective, the S corporation's distributions might be considered a return of capital to the extent of the recipient's basis in the shares. This means that non-deductible contributions to the corporation do not increase the recipient's basis, and, as a result, only the recipient\u2019s basis can later be returned to them in the form of cash or property.\n\n13. For your final answer \u2013 Considering this S corporation scenario:\n\nCarson's expected tax distribution = $47,380\n(Non-deductible contribution) = $28,000 + $28,000 = $56,000 (equal to taxable income)\n\nFinal distributable cash dividends to Carson = $28,000 + $28,000 = $56,000\n\nTherefore, if the company had been an S corporation with equal shareholders, Carson would have reported $56,000 in taxable income from S corporation, rather than $42,000. Hence, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) $188,000",
