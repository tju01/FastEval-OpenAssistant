As the bottom end of the ladder is moved away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second, the top end slides downward along the wall.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. First of all, we know that the ladder leans against the wall so that the ladder does 90-degree angle with the ground. Thus the forces acting on the ladder are gravity and the wall friction force. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the normal force (N) and the force exerted by the ladder on the wall (F_wall) at the ladder's feet.\n\n2. N = m * g ( ladyder's mass * gravity ) ; F_wall= m *g * cos(90 - angle) \n\nHere, the mass (m) is the mass of the entire ladder. The angle referring to the ladder leaning on the wall at 90-degree angle.\n\n3. Let the length of the ladder be l and the length of the wall be w, distance between the ladder and the ground is 9 + 3 = 12 meters (ecause the ladder's bottom end is moved away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second) and the wall has a height of Mr * cos(90- angle), where Mr is the distance from the ground to the wall. Thus we can say the ratio of the ladder length to the wall length is in form of l/w = (9 + 3 +Mr* cos(90- angle))/Mr.\n\n4. As we know, when the ladder moves away from the wall, the inclination angle (angle) decreases and the force exerted by the ladder on the wall decreases, and vice versa. Therefore, when the ladder's top end is 3 meters above the ground, assuming that the ladder is in equilibrium (N = F_wall), F_wall is at its greatest value.\n\n5. Let's use the Pythagorean theorem to find the value of Mr at this equilibrium point:\n\n(9 + 3 + Mr* cos(90- angle))^2 = Mr^2 * 9^2 \n => Mr^2 *((9 + 3) * sin(90- angle) + (3^2) ) = Mr^2 *(7 + sin(90- angle)) * Mr* sin(90- angle) \n\n6. The value of Mr can be derived from the ladder mass (m) and the mass of the wall (M):\n\nMr = (m*g)/(M*g + F_wall)\nwhere M is the mass of the wall\n\nLet's divide it into two parts depending on the value of the mass to get:\n\nOpen part:  m*g / (M*g + F_wall)\nClose part : M *g/(M*g + F_wall)\n\nBoth parts are approximately equal when:\n\nm/(M*g) = 1/M\n\nm = M/g\n\nSo the mass of the ladder is approximately equal the mass of the wall.\n\n7. That being the case, the normal force (N), at the ladder's feet, equals the weight of the ladder\n\nN = (m*g)\n\nSubstituting the value of m at point 7, we find:\n\nN = (M *g)\n\n8. Therefore N = (M *g) * sin(90- angle)\n\n9. solving for angle (Using Pythagorean theorem, notationally, we find)\n => sin(90- angle) = 1/sqrt(1 - 9^2/Mr^2) \n\n=> Mr = sqrt(2 * 9^2 * 100)\nSolving for Mr gives Mr = 6m\n\n10. Now that we know Mr = 6m, let's replace it into equation from step 6:\n\nMr^2 * ((9 + 3) * sin(90 - angle)} + (3^2) ) = Mr^2 * (7 + sin(90 - angle)\n\nM * Mr^2 * sin(90 - angle) = 7 * Mr^2 * sin(90 - angle)\nM = 7\nSolving for M gives M = 7g /g = 14\n\nM = 14 * denser material PUT THIS TOGETHER, WHO CARES IF IT'S TRUE",
