            "model_answer": "1. In 2020 medical knowledge, the recommended size of cannula for a rapid blood transfusion would likely be larger than in the past, due to improvements in materials, technology, and techniques.\n\n2. Considering this fact, we should evaluate each option and eliminate the smaller gauge options first, since they might be too small and time-consuming when rapid transfusions are required.\n\n3. Here is a rough guide to cannula gauge sizes in blood transfusions:\n\n   18 gauge (0.635 mm): Slower transfusion rate, smaller needle size; generally suitable for pediatric patients.\n    \n   20 gauge (0.572 mm): Moderate transfusion rate, suitable for most adults. This is also smaller than the current recommendation in 2020 medical knowledge.\n    \n   22 gauge (0.515 mm): Faster transfusion rate, used in critical situations; smaller than standard adult sizes. It is too small, so we can eliminate this option.\n    \n   24 gauge (0.587 mm): The smallest option with the fastest transfusion rate, used in critical situations, typically pediatric patients, and in case of challenging vein access; this is also too small and could be eliminated.\n\n4. Based on our reasoning, we can see that the smallest cannula gauge commonly used for rapid blood transfusions in adults is the 20 gauge. So, the correct answer is:\n\n    (B) 20 gauge.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which attribute is most important for successful marathon running, let's examine each option (A) strength, (B) power, (C) stride length, and (D) stamina and their relevance to marathon running:\n\n(A) Strength: Strength provides the foundation for explosive power, which can be crucial in short sprints, but not necessarily in long-distance running.\n\n(B) Power: Power is the ability to push against resistance with speed and force. While it can result from strength, it primarily pertains to efforts like Olympic weightlifting and sprints, and may not be as relevant in marathon running.\n\n(C) Stride length: Stride length refers to the distance between the vertical position of the feet as they hit the ground. This has more relevance to distance running as it helps maintain a consistent and efficient mechanical pattern; however, it is not the sole driver of marathon running success.\n\n(D) Stamina: Stamina is the body's ability to sustain continuous and prolonged resistance. In a marathon, the race lasts over several hours, requiring the ability to maintain endurance and energy levels throughout those several hours.\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems that option (D) stamina is the most important attribute for successful marathon running.\n\nAnswer: (D).",

            "model_answer": "To determine which of these options is NOT a symptom of anaphylaxis, we must first know what anaphylaxis is and its associated symptoms.\n\nAnaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs when an allergen, such as a food or medication, penetrates a person's body and triggers an immune response. It is a rapid-onset, multi-system reaction that requires immediate medical attention.\n\nSymptoms of anaphylaxis vary but can include:\n1. Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.\n2. Swelling of the throat, tongue, or face.\n3. Low blood pressure.\n4. Vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) which can cause skin redness and itching.\n5. Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n6. Heat or hives.\n7. Dizziness or loss of consciousness.\n8. Severe wheeze.\n\nNow, let's analyze each of the given options:\n(A) Stridor - It is a noise (a high-pitched wheeze) made while inhaling due to a breathing difficulty. It is one of the symptoms mentioned in point 3 above.\n(B) Bradycardia - This means a slow heartbeat. While not usually a direct consequence of anaphylaxis, it could be an indirect result of the rapid onset and severity of an anaphylactic reaction, making it relevant in this context.\n(C) Severe wheeze - It is already mentioned as one of the symptoms in point 3 above and is also mentioned in point 8, further confirming its presence as a symptom.\n(D) Rash - While a rash can sometimes be associated with an anaphylactic reaction, it is not one of the core symptoms.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Rash - It is not a symptom of anaphylaxis, as it is not an essential or common characteristic of the condition.",

A closed pouch can be used after colostomy surgery for collecting the feces.\n\n(C) In the immediate post-operative period.\n- After some surgeries, patients may be prescribed closed pouch use during their immediate post-operative period to monitor output, ease infection risk, and generally provide continence.\n\n(D) The patient has a urostomy.\n- A urostomy refers to the surgical creation of a passage through the abdominal wall for the diversion of urine. A closed pouch can be used after a urostomy surgery for the collection and storage of urine.\n\nBased on the information provided above, all four options can be considered situations in which closed pouches may be applied.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's consider the given options one by one:\n\nA) Anaerobic contribution progressively increases: When a person does more sprints, their muscles work harder, requiring more energy. To meet this increased energy demand, the body relies on anaerobic metabolism, which is faster but less efficient. So, with an increasing number of sprints, the anaerobic contribution progressively increases.\n\nB) pH of the muscle falls below 6.0: During sprints, lactic acid is produced and released as a byproduct of muscle activity. As the pH of the muscle decreases below the normal range, it becomes more acidic. However, the pH of a healthy muscle typically stays within a range of 6.8-7.2, which is above 6.0.\n\nC) Blood glucose concentration falls below 3 mmol/L: After a sprint, the body releases glycogen, which gets converted into glucose to provide energy. As the body depletes its glycogen stores, glucose concentration levels might decrease. Generally, blood glucose levels below 3 mmol/L indicate that the body is becoming depleted of its stored glucose.\n\nD) Relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases: Sprints involve high-intensity exercise, which last for a short duration. As a result, the energy requirement is high but the time available for the energy production is limited. In such conditions, aerobic metabolism does not have enough time to become a significant energy source. As a result, anaerobic metabolism becomes a greater percentage of the total energy production.\n\nStep 1: Analyzing the options one by one, option D seems to be logically consistent with the statement \"With an increasing number of sprints.\"\nStep 2: This option states that with an increasing number of sprints, the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases.\nStep 3: The answer should be based on the best evidence available that corresponds with the argument provided in the statement. In this case, option D provides the best reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is:\n\n(D) Relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered - Diplopia can occur if one eye is covered temporarily due to factors such as a foreign object or an injury, but it is not the only explanation. When one eye is covered, monocular diplopia occurs instead. Diplopia refers to seeing double, which occurs when both eyes are opened and seeing two images instead of one.\n\n(B) The outer image is always the false image - Diplopia typically occurs when an individual has problems with aligning their eyes, which can make their eyes work together poorly or mix up the images they are seeing. The outer image may be the false image sometimes, but not always.\n\n(C) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards - A third nerve palsy usually occurs when an individual has a vertical misalignment of their eyes, meaning when the patient looks upwards, the third nerve palsy would get worse causing diplopia. A fourth nerve palsy usually does not cause diplopia due to different reasons and is not related to the direction of gaze.\n\n(D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint - A sixth nerve palsy typically affects the lateral rectus muscles resulting in the eyes moving outwards. It is a horizontal, rather than a vertical misalignment. This would lead to horizontal diplopia, not a vertically-oriented issue.\n\nNone of the statements (A, B, C, D) are universally true in diplopia, as there are many different causes and circumstances in which diplopia can occur.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "First, let's quickly consider what sodium bicarbonate does. Sodium bicarbonate (also known as baking soda) is an alkaline substance. When ingested, it creates a slight increase in blood pH levels (with a pH of 8.6) short term (up to 24 hours). This increase is due to the production of hydrogen carbonate (HCO\u00b3) ions which neutralize hydrogen ions (H\u207a), a byproduct of cellular metabolism.\n\n(A) Sodium bicarbonate elevates the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid, stabilizing the increase in hydrogen ions due to cellular metabolism when running. This makes muscle cells work more efficiently, leading to improvements in middle-distance running performance.\n(B) This choice actually contradicts the description of what sodium bicarbonate does. By increasing alkalinity, it is not reducing pH but rather reducing the danger of muscle fatigue and pain.\n(C) Sodium bicarbonate doesn't enhance the influx of hydrogen ions into muscles; rather, it promotes the balance of ions within muscles and prevents the build-up of hydrogen ions responsible for muscle fatigue. \n(D) This choice seems to imply that the reason for better performance is simply a pre-exercise increase in muscle pH. While it's likely that better intracellular pH might be important, the primary reason for sodium bicarbonate's efficacy in improving middle-distance running is its effect on the extracellular matrix, as described in option A.\n\nTherefore, option (A) is the correct answer.",

The other options are incorrect because:\n\n(A) Codons cannot be triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA, as we are specifically referring to the specific sequence; plus, mRNA does not contain any triplet sequences.\n\n(B) Codons contain deoxyribose sugars in percentages of three, perfect for being a triplet. There can be various lengths of these quadruple sequences, but strictly speaking, a codon can only be a triplet sequence.\n\n(C) Codons are not composed of triplet sequences of amino acids in polypeptide chains, as they code for amino acids, while amino acids are protein building blocks rather than a direct component of the codon itself.\n\nHence, a codon is composed of triplet sequences of deoxyribose sugars in DNA.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Fatty acids are long chains of hydrocarbons with a carboxyl group at one end, which are primarily used as an energy source in cells. They need to be converted to a form usable by the cell's energy-producing machinery, the electron transport chain. To enter the mitochondria and participate in the energy-producing process, the fatty acids must first undergo a series of modifications.\n\n(A) Thiokinase is an enzyme that facilitates the conversion of the methyl group in methionine or the thioester group in acyl-CoA esters into thiol groups. While thiokinase does perform a crucial step in the formation of an intermediate required during fatty acid metabolism, its primary role is not in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria.\n\n(B) Coenzyme A (CoA) or acyl-CoA is what fatty acids are transported bound to. Coenzyme A is a crucial molecule in numerous metabolic reactions, including those related to fatty acid metabolism. It is a pyridine nucleotide that carries a stable alkyloxy (alkoxycarbonyl) group (derived from the addition of a fatty acid) bound to its acyl carbon atom. When bound to the fatty acid chain, it is referred to as an acyl-CoA. This modified fatty acid can then be transported into the mitochondria for further metabolism.\n\n(C) Acetyl-CoA, while similar, is not the correct answer. Acetyl-CoA is an abbreviation of acetyl-CoA-thioester, which is an important multifunctional molecule participating in various areas of biochemistry, including glycolysis and the citric acid cycle (or Krebs cycle). Although it carries an alkyloxy group similar to that found in fatty acids, its origin and function are different from those of acyl-CoA.\n\n(D) Carnitine is a water-soluble vitamin-like compound that helps transport long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria. It is translocated across the inner mitochondrial membrane using the carnitine acyltransferase enzyme. Upon entering the mitochondria, the fatty acids are incorporated into the cell's energy-producing processes.\n\nIn conclusion, fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria bound to acyl-CoA (Option B), where they can be further broken down and utilized during the process of oxidative phosphorylation in the electron transport chain.",
