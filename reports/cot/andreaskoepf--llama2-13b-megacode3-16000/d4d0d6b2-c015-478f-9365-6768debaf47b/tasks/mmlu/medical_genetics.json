            "model_answer": "First, let's think about what we know about Robertsonian translocation:\n\n- A Robertsonian translocation is a type of chromosome translocation, which is a rare genetic deletion event.\n- Robertsonian translocations typically occur between the non-sister chromatids of the homologous chromosomes.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) telomeres: Telomeres are the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes. They are not involved in the fusion process in Robertsonian translocations.\n\n(B) centromeres: Centromeres are located near the center of chromosomes and are not directly involved in the fusion in Robertsonian translocations.\n\n(C) histones: Histones are proteins that help package up DNA, and they are not part of the translocation process.\n\n(D) ends of the long arms: The ends of the long arms are more likely to be susceptible to translocations as there is more opportunity for DNA interactions in these areas.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the most likely answer is that fusion occurs in the (D) ends of the long arms.\n\nAnswer: (D)",

            "question": "If the frequency of males affected with an X-linked recessive condition in a human population is .10 (one in ten), what will be the expected frequency of affected females?\n\n(A) 0.01\n(B) 0.001\n(C) 0.02\n(D) 0.0001",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, it's necessary to know that in humans, X-linked recessive conditions are affected by a gene found on the X chromosome, and the conditiones are passed on from mother to child. Now, let's recall the rules:\n\n- Since the condition is X-linked and recessive, both males and females can be affected, but there is typically a difference in the expression of the condition based on gender.\n- Males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, so if a male has the affected gene, he will be male and affected. \n- Females have two X chromosomes. Generally, a female who has the affected gene on one X chromosome is less likely to be affected or mildly affected, and a female who has the affected gene on both X chromosomes is more likely to be severely affected.\n\nNow, let's use this information to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. We know that the frequency of males affected by the condition is .10, which means that 10% of males are affected. \n2. If 10% of males are affected, then there must be 90% of males who are not affected, which means they have normal X chromosomes and produce normal offspring. \n3. Since only females experience any discernible effect of X-linked recessive conditions, we can conclude that the other 10% of females who are not affected are only so because they have normal X chromosomes (and unaffected or carrier mothers). \n4. Now, since there are 2 types of females: affected and unaffected, we can calculate the frequency of both:\n   - The proportion of unaffected females is simply: 1 - .10 = .90 (or 90%)\n   - The proportion of affected females is: .10 - .90 = .10 (or 10%)\n5. In conclusion, females who are affected or have abnormal X chromosomes, which is the only way they can express this recessive condition. So given that there is 10% of males affected, the expected frequency of affected females will be the same: 10%.",

            "model_answer": "To answer the question step-by-step, we need to consider the knowledge of DNA's structure and the pairing rules for nitrogenous bases. We know that DNA is a double helix and each strand pairs with its complementary strand. Nitrogenous bases are the functional groups that make up the nucleotides in the DNA and can be classified into two types: purines (adenine [A] and guanine [G]) and pyrimidines (cytosine [C], thymine [T], and uracil [U]). \n\nThe normal base pairing in DNA is A-T and C-G. Let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) cytosine: Cytosine can pair either with guanine (G) or thymine (T) in DNA depending on the strand they occur on.\n\n(B) guanine: Guanine pairs with cytosine (C) on the complimentary strand in DNA. \n\n(C) thymine: Thymine pairs with adenine (A) on the complementary strand in DNA.\n\n(D) uracil: Uracil is a modified version of thymine and is replaced by thymine in RNA.

All offspring have a 50% chance of being affected.\n(B) Autosomal recessive: This pattern means that the condition is inherited from two affected parents; the chance of inheriting the mutation is 100%, and all offspring will be affected unless they have two unaffected parents.\n(C) X-linked dominant: This pattern means that the condition is inherited from an affected mother, and the risk of inheritance for her son is 50%.

We still need to determine which choice is the most successful before we can make this observation.\n\nD: This statement assumes that the DNA involved in coding genes is an important factor in determining the success of mapping human chromosomes.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, let's understand what exon skipping is. Exon skipping is the process where certain exons, or units of transcribed genes, are deleted or skipped in the DNA sequence while retaining the splice site junctions. This results in an altered mRNA and gene product, usually leading to a protein that contains alterations or gaps.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Nonsense mutations are Insertions or deletions that usually lead to the formation of a stop codon, which results in a truncated protein. This could be related to exon skipping, as a skipped exon can lead to a frame-skipping that affects the reading frame of the mRNA. But exon skipping itself is a distinct phenomenon.\n\n(B) Regulatory mutations refer to any mutations that affect the regulation of gene expression, such as increased or decreased production of the protein or RNA. Exon skipping does not significantly affect gene expression regulation, so it doesn't align with the definition of regulatory mutations.\n\n(C) RNA processing mutations involve alterations in the rate or efficiency of RNA processing, such as splicing or polyadenylation. Exon skipping directly affects splicing, which is a process typically regulated by introns and exons. Therefore, this option seems to be the most fitting one.\n\n(D) Silent mutations are substitutions, insertions, or deletions that do not change the protein sequence or amino acids. Since exon skipping results in a change in the protein sequence, this doesn't apply.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n(C) RNA processing mutations.",
