            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each option.\n\n(A) The Retail Merchants Association is an organization representing retailers and focuses on advocating for their interests. Although it could provide some relevant information, it is not the primary source of credit rating information.\n\n(B) The local chamber of commerce is an association of businessmen and businesswomen aimed at promoting their respective cities. It may provide valuable information on local industries but would unlikely focus specifically on credit ratings of retail businesses.\n\n(C) Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. is a company that specializes in providing credit rating and business solutions. They mainly focus on collecting and analyzing financial information about businesses, which would make them the primary source of credit rating information for retail businesses.\n\n(D) The United States Retail Credit Association was dissolved and its assets were transferred to Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. in 1933. This suggests that Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. would be responsible for US credit rating information, making option (C) the most appropriate answer.\n\nBased on the analysis, the primary source of information on the credit rating of retail businesses is Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., making (C) the correct answer. The complete answer is \"(C) Dun & Bradstreet, Inc.\"",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(A) Conferencing\n\nThe definition that best fits this instructional strategy is conferencing, which is the collaborative process where teachers work with students in small groups or one-on-one to facilitate learning and understanding. In this case, the teacher assigns short stories to the students and encourages interaction by discussing the characteristics of a short story. This helps learners develop a deeper understanding of the genre.\n\nThe other options do not fit:\n\n(B) Discipline-based inquiry: This refers to research in a specific field or discipline, which doesn't specifically address the given instructional strategy.\n\n(C) Self-Regulated Strategy Development (SRSD): Though SRSD involves a similar guided approach to teaching and learning for students, it's unclear how it would be specifically applied in this context. The given scenario seems more focused on interactive discussion and collaborative analysis of short stories.\n\n(D) Introduction-Body-Conclusion strategy: This refers to a written format for an argumentative essay, which does not fit the given instructional context.",

The question asks for the first names of the early American explorers Lewis and Clark.\n\nNow, we'll determine the correct answer by utilizing the information provided in each option:\n\n(A) Morgan and Mason - While the name \"Morgan\" seems to reference a historical figure, \"Mason\" could be a random addition or may not make sense as a first name for the pair. This option is not likely to be correct.\n\n(B) Meriwether and William - Meriwether was a common name in the Lewis and Clark expedition team. Furthermore, Meriwether Lewis himself was a prominent member who shares this name, so it is likely to be the correct answer. \"William,\" on the other hand, is a very common name so including it just for the sake of having two first names doesn't make a strong case.\n\n(C) Cabot and Joseph - This option seems disconnected from any historical figures associated with the Lewis and Clark expedition. There aren't any explorers specifically known as \"Cabot\" or \"Joseph\" in this context.\n\n(D) Meredith and George - While \"George\" is a common name, the name \"Meredith\" is not particularly known among the American explorers of the early frontier period, especially when considering the Lewis and Clark expedition.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most probable option for the first names of the early American explorers Lewis and Clark is:\n\n(B) Meriwether and William",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine which of the following materials has a resistance that is LEAST affected by temperature changes, we need to look at the temperature coefficient of each material's resistance, which can be found in physics textbooks or from the manufacturer. Let's evaluate.\n\nStep 1: Copper (A)\nResistance in copper changes with temperature due to temperature coefficient. The resistivity of copper rises with temperature, so the resistance will also rise when the temperature rises. However, copper is quite stable at the range of temperatures associated with room and building construction, which usually goes from -40\u00b0C to 85\u00b0C. The temperature coefficient is in the range of 0.0000706 for temperatures between -55\u00b0C to +85\u00b0C.\n\nStep 2: Carbon (B)\nCarbon is known for its temperature coefficient of resistance being one of the lowest among common materials. It's a vital component in high accuracy resistors designed to work at high temparatures and high accuracy requirements. Carbon resistors' temperature coefficient ranges from -2.1e-4 to -0.0021 for a temperature range between -55\u00b0C to +175\u00b0C.\n\nStep 3: Germanium (C)\nGermanium is a semiconductor material. While it certainly has some temperature coefficient of resistance you'd find in metals and ceramics, a detailed analysis on the precision is required as the coefficient can vary based on the detailed strain, temperature, type of doping, and other factors. Generally speaking, its temperature coefficient of resistivity ranges from -1.4 to +12.8 for temperatures between -55\u00b0C to +200\u00b0C. Significant gap between negative and positive values of resistance means low precision working.\n\nStep 4: Silicon (D)\nSilicon is another semiconductor material. Like Germanium, the temperature coefficient of resistivity in silicone can vary based on various factors including the type of silicon used and doping. That said, silicon doesn't generally respond much as temperatures change after 25\u00b0C, with the typical range of the temperature coefficient being -1.8E-3 to -0.0047 for temperatures between -55\u00b0C to +100\u00b0C. This is a lesser change that the other materials mentioned.\n\nStep 5: Least Affected by Temperature Changes\nFrom the evaluation, silicon (D) is the material that has resistance LEAST affected by temperature changes. \n\nSo, the answer is Silicon (D).",
