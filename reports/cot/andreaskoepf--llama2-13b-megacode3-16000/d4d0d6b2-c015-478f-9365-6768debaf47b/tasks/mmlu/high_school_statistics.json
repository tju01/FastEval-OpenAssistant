            "model_answer": "The given problem is about finding the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders at a new roller coaster ride. To solve this, we need to determine the probability that a wait time for 100,000 riders will be within a certain range.\n\nStep 1: Finding the upper and lower limits of the range\nFirst, let's calculate the range of possible waiting times for 100,000 riders based on our given mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution:\n\nMean = 35 minutes\nStandard Deviation = 10 minutes\n\nLower Limit = 35 - 2 * Standard Deviation (Z-score = -2)\nUpper Limit = 35 + 2 * Standard Deviation (Z-score = 2)\n\nLower Limit = 35 - 2 * 10 beings 35 - 20 = 15 minutes\nUpper Limit = 35 + 2 * 10 beings 35 + 20 = 55 minutes\n\nStep 2: Computing the probability for each range\nNow that we have the upper and lower limits of our range of waiting times, we can calculate the probability for each range. Since the distribution is normally distributed, we will construct two standard normal distribution functions: one for the lower limit and one for the upper limit.\n\nStandard Normal Distribution Function (Z): F(x) = 1 / \u221a(2\u03c0) *  temperamma (x/ \u0421)\n\nProbability derived from the standard normal distribution function: P(X < -2) and P(X > 2).\n\nP(-2 \u2264 Z \u2264 2) = 0.9755\n\nStep 3: Selecting the range with the smallest probability\nComparing the probabilities for the different ranges, we find that the probability for a wait time less than 31.7 minutes is lower than for the other three ranges:\n\nRange (A) 0 to 31.7 minutes: P < 0.9755 * 0.9755 = 0.9487\nRange (B) 31.7 to 39.3 minutes: P Intermediate = 0.9487 * P(Z \u2264 2) = 0.9487 * 0.9755 = 0.937\nRange (C) 25.3 to 44.7 minutes: P Intermediate = 0.937 * P(-2 \u2264 Z \u2264 2) = 0.937 * 0.9755 = 0.92557\nRange (D) 25.3 to 35 minutes: P Intermediate = 0.92557 * P(-2 \u2264 Z \u2264 2) = 0.92557 * 0.9755 = 0.9122\n\nConclusion:\nThe shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders is Range (A) 0 to 31.7 minutes, as it has the smallest probability of 0.9487.\n\nSo the answer is (A) 0 to 31.7 minutes.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Let's consider each statement step-by-step and determine if it is true.\n\n(A) If there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 10% level, then there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 5% level.\n\nThis statement is true according to the Principle of Homogeneity or the two-tailed test. The significance level does not determine whether the null hypothesis is rejected; instead, having sufficient evidence (or a p-value below the significance level). Therefore, if there is sufficient evidence at the 10% level, it implies the null hypothesis is rejected at the 5% level as well.\n\n(B) Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered.\n\nThis statement is true. The decision of whether to use a one-sided or a two-sided test depends on the research hypothesis. If the researcher is unsure about the direction of the relationship and wants to consider both positive and negative effects, they can use a two-sided test. On the other hand, if the researcher is only interested in a specific outcome, they can use a one-sided test. Typically, this decision is made after the data collection.\n\n(C) If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\nThis statement is true if we assume that the test follows a standard normal distribution. The P-value equals the area under the curve for the test statistic given the null hypothesis, which represents the probability of obtaining a sample outcome that is as extreme as the observed outcome or more extreme in the direction of the null hypothesis. In the case of the 1% level, there is a 1% probability of obtaining a test statistic greater than or equal to the critical value, leading to rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\n(D) The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.\n\nThis statement is true. The power of a hypothesis test measures the probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. In other words, the power measures the test's ability to detect a difference when it in fact exists. Higher power means that the test can reject the null hypothesis more often when the alternative hypothesis is true, which is useful in making decisions based on the test results.",

The interval messages that 95% of the population is fallen within the range. It also implies that every person in the school has an income between $35,095 and $45,005, which is clearly not the case as the interval provides a range for the population or mean.\n\n(C) This statement is also incorrect because it assumes that we repeat the process using the same assumption about the distribution and the data collected which cannot be guaranteed in practice.\n\n(D) This statement is the correct interpretation. The 95% confidence interval ($35,095, $45,005) indicates that there is 95% confidence that the population average for families' income is within the range of $35,095 and $45,005. In simple language, it means that if we took an infinite number of random samples from the same populations, most (95%) of these intervals would include the mean income value for the group.\n\nGiven this context, the most accurate interpretation would be answer (D).

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand what t-distributions are. T-distributions are the probability density functions of samples of a normal distribution when the number of observations is small relative to the number of population parameters. T-distributions are not a specific type of distribution; rather, they are a family of distributions that can be created by applying a t-score to a variable in a dataset.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each option separately:\n\n(A) T-distributions come in different shapes and forms based on the degrees of freedom (df). The shape of the t-distribution varies depending on the degrees of freedom (df), which come in integer form (e.g., n-1, n, or n+1). Generally, the higher the df, the fatter the t-distribution. While these variations exist, it does not mean that every t-distribution shape is different. For example, an n-degree of freedom t-distribution has the same shape as an (n-1)-degree of freedom t-distribution (both are symmetric). However, when df becomes very large, the t-distribution does not differ significantly from a normal distribution anymore.\n\n(B) T-distributions are often slightly skewed and not always perfectly bell-shaped. The degree of skewness depends on the value of df. In large df, t-distributions are closer to a normal distribution in terms of shape.\n\n(C) T-distributions do not always have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The mean and standard deviation of a t-distribution depend on the parameters of the specific normal distribution that generates it. Most often, these values are 0 and 1 when the sample size is small compared to the total population size.\n\n(D) The t-distribution is more spread out than the normal distribution when df is smaller than df (n-1) in the Student-t distribution. The wings of the t-distribution extend further in each direction than the shape of a normal distribution. The difference increases as df gets smaller, creating more extreme values outside the range of a typical normal distribution.\n\nFinal Answer: The correct answer is (C) T-distributions do not always have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.",
