            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

            "question": "A 25-year-old gravida 3 para 2 female is admitted to the hospital at 39\u00a0weeks' gestation in active labor. She had been having regular contractions every 4\u00a0minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6\u00a0hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100%\u00a0effaced and 7\u00a0cm dilated. The most likely diagnosis is\n\n(A) Braxton Hicks contractions\n(B) lower uterine retraction ring\n(C) hypotonic uterine dysfunction\n(D) primary dysfunctional labor",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: The patient is 39 weeks' gestation, which indicates that delivery could be imminent soon. Observe the fact that she was in active labor with regular contractions and now has only a few intermittent, weak contractions.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that regular contractions have decreased and become weaker. This could be concerning since it could indicate a potential problem.\n\nStep 3: Consider the patient's medical history. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6 hours. This could be an indication of discomfort related to the labor process.\n\nStep 4: Assess the examination findings. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100% effaced and 7cm dilated. While these are positive signs, they do not guarantee a successful delivery.\n\nStep 5: Analyze the possible diagnoses:\n\n(A) Braxton Hicks contractions: These are involuntary uterine contractions that usually occur during pregnancy and do not necessarily need treatment. Generally, they are caused by increased blood flow to the uterus or stress. They are intermittent and painless, and often do not lead to labor. They typically stop when you rest or take a warm bath.\n\n(B) Lower uterine retraction ring: This condition is characterized by a ring-shaped lesion that limits the uterus's ability to expand. It can result in a delay in labor, often requiring medical intervention to allow the baby to be delivered.\n\n(C) Hypotonic uterine dysfunction: In this condition, the uterus does not contract as effectively as it should during labor. It is usually caused by an imbalance of muscles that control the uterus. This can lead to impaired progress in labor and may require medical intervention.\n\n(D) Primary dysfunctional labor: This condition is challenging to define as primary dysfunctional labor often includes a combination of potential diagnoses. It usually refers to labor dystocia, which is the prolongation of the first stage of labor (where contractions may not be strong enough or regular enough to cause cervical dilation and progress through the birth canal).\n\nStep 6: Compare the possible diagnoses with the patient's symptoms and examination findings:\n\n(A) Braxton Hicks contractions do not match the current situation where contractions are weaker and less frequent.\n(B) Lower uterine retraction ring is not evident in the patient's case as the cervix is dilated to 7cm.\n(C) Hypotonic uterine dysfunction aligns well with the decrease in contractions the patient is experiencing. Additionally, given the patient's history of premature contractions, it could be a cause for concern.\n(D) PRIMARY DYSFUNCTIONAL LABOR is a likely possibility given that the patient is in labor with weaker contractions and not showing significant dilation or progress.\n\nStep 7: Consider the specific symptoms and medical history in the case of hypotonic uterine dysfunction and primary dysfunctional labor:\n\nUnlike Braxton Hicks contractions, which are involuntary and should resolve on their own, both hypotonic uterine dysfunction and primary dysfunctional labor may require medical intervention to facilitate progress in labor.\n\nStep 8: Arrive at a conclusion based on the analysis:\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is likely a combination of PRIMARY DYSFUNCTIONAL LABOR and HYPOTONIC UTERINE DYSFUNCTION, as both exhibit similar symptoms in the patient's case, including: fewer contractions, weaker contractions, and no significant dilation or progress being made in labor.\n\nStep 9: Output the answer:\n\nD",

The patient is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI, and his vital signs are normal (temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg).\n\n3. Cardiovascular examination reveals a grade 3/6 systolic murmur, weak femoral pulses, and a radiofemoral delay, indicating possible issues with the heart structure or function.\n\n4. X-ray imaging shows mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence and an ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n5. Based on these findings and medical history, we need to determine which complications this patient is at a greatest risk for.\n\n6. Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder causing rapid and irregular heartbeats, which is not mentioned in the patient's findings or medical history, therefore, it's not the most likely complication.\n\n7. Cor pulmonale occurs due to chronic pulmonary hypertension and is unlikely in this situation since the patient has no symptoms or history of respiratory issues, and the related risks don't match the patient's situation.\n\n8. Systemic hypertension, which refers to high blood pressure, is also unlikely as the patient's blood pressure is within normal range, and no other indications of this condition are present.\n\n9. Tricuspid valve regurgitation occurs when blood from the upper chamber (atria) flows back into the lower chamber (ventricles) due to a faulty tricuspid valve. The patient's ECG shows signs of left ventricular hypertrophy, indicating that the heart is working harder to pump blood, which suggests that there may be a problem with the tricuspid valve.\n\nBased on the information provided, this patient is at the greatest risk for tricuspid valve regurgitation.",

Parotid node involvement is an indicator of advanced lesions and poor prognosis. Squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue can spread to the jaw, which is supplied by the parotid nodes. Drawing a vein for tissue diagnosing from the parotid nodes is accessible, making it an ideal choice for initial evaluation.\n\n(C) Retropharyngeal: The retropharyngeal nodes are just above the larynx and below the prelaryngeal space and are general nodes for the tongue, throat, and pharynx.
