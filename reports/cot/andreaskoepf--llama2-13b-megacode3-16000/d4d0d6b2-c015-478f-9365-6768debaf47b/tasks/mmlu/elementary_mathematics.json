For now, let's not worry about any potential leftover money and treat the amount as if it were $90.00.\n\nStep 2: Set up an equation to solve for X (the number of soccer balls).\nBased on the given information and the equation in step 1, we want to solve for X, the number of soccer balls, such that the total cost is equal to $90.00.\n\nX = 15.60\n\nStep 3: Now let's plug in our final answer from step 2 into this expression:\n\nX = 15.60\nStatement of the problem: \"If one soccer ball costs $15.60, what is the greatest number of soccer balls the team can buy?\" In this statement, \"If\" is the same as \"Subject to the condition that\", and \"$15.60 (cost of one soccer ball)\" in the statement is an equivalent expression of the symbol \"X\".\n\nStep 4: Solve for X by dividing both sides of the equation by the cost of one soccer ball (which is $15.60).\n\nX = 15.60 / 15.60 = 1\n\nStep 5: This step provides the answer:\nX = 1\nHowever, this doesn't necessarily mean they can buy one soccer ball.
