So, he cannot have been available between 10am-3pm (Linda's sighting), and cannot have been at the movie theater between 7pm-10pm (Sean's sighting) as the movies closed by 10pm.\n\nStep 2: Identify the available times.\n\nJason was available during the time gap between when Linda saw him at the cafe and when Jennifer saw him walking towards the Statue of Liberty. So, we need to find the time difference between those two sightings.\n\nJennifer saw Jason at 6pm, and Linda saw him at 10am.\nTime difference = 6pm - 10am = 6 hours\n\nSo because the movies were closed after 10pm, Jason could have been at the movies during the first 6 hours of the day (while he was available).\n\nStep 3: Choose the appropriate option based on the available time.\n\nSince our time window is 6 hours and Linda saw Jason at 10am, Jason could have gone to the movies between 10am and 4pm. These hours account for the entire time Jason was at the electronics store according to Sean.\n\nFurthermore, we are given that Jason went to the movies. So, we need to include time spent at the movies within this window.

Here is the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. William saw Sarah buying a bike at the bike shop from 9am to 12pm. So, we know that Sarah must have left the bike shop by 12pm.\n2. Emily saw Sarah waiting at the airport from 12pm to 1 pm. Since Sarah left the bike shop at 12pm and was at the airport at 1 pm, this overlaps with her time at the bike shop. Therefore, we can only consider Sarah's presence at the airport from 12pm to 1pm.\n3. Jennifer saw Sarah taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 2pm to 5pm. Since she was leaving the airport at 1pm, she must have been at the Eiffel Tower from 2pm to 5pm.

Since Sarah was at the water park from 5pm to 6pm, she must have left the water park before the clothing store was closed.\n\nNow let's identify the time frame when Sarah could have been at the clothing store:\n\nSarah started her time at the clothing store after she left the water park/before 6pm.\nSarah ended her time at the clothing store before 12pm since she started buying a bike at the bike shop immediately after leaving the store.\n\nThere is a 5-hour gap between 12pm (ending time at the Eiffel Tower) and 12pm (starting time at the bike shop), during which Sarah was at the clothing store but did not account for her presence at the bike shop nor her presence at the Eiffel Tower. So, we need to find a 5-hour-long time frame within this gap. \n\nThe clothing store was closed after 6pm (since it was closed after 12pm and Sarah left the water park at 5pm). If Sarah went to the clothing store immediately after leaving the bike shop, she would have had to be there until 12pm.

However, since Linda left the train station at 12pm, this time window is too early for Linda to have gone to the beach.\n  - The next possibility is the overlapping time between David's sighting at the office (2pm to 4pm) and the beach (12pm to 12pm). Since Linda left the office at 2pm and went to the beach from 12pm, she could not have visited the beach during this time window either.\n  - The overlapping time between Sarah's sighting at the airport (4pm to 5pm) and the beach (12pm to 12pm) is 5pm to 10pm as Linda went to the airport at 5pm which works with the beach visit.\n\nStep 4: Determine the latest possible start time for Linda's beach visit. Since she could have visited the beach between 12pm and the end of the day, the latest possible start time is 9pm based on the overlapping time between Linda's sighting at the garden (9pm to 10pm) and the beach (9pm to 10pm).\n\nSince the beach was closed after 10pm, Linda had to have left the beach before 10pm. This leaves a small window between the end of David's sighting and Linda's sighting at the garden (2pm to 9pm). However, Linda had to have got to the beach before 2pm if she wanted to spend time at the beach before the beach closed.\n\nStep 5: Conclude the answer. Based on the analysis, the latest possible start time for Linda's beach visit is 9pm, and the earliest possible end time is 10pm, which leaves a time window of 1 hour. Thus, between 12pm to 1pm is the only time window when Linda could have gone to the beach.\n\nThe answer is (A) 12pm to 2pm.",

Sean saw William taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 9am to 12pm. Thus:\n- After Sean's observation (12pm), William could have had the remaining time until the art studio closed at 10pm, which is from:\n  12pm to 8pm                            (Since he did not see William during this time)\n\nStep 3: Check Susan's observation. Susan saw William working at the office from 12pm to 8pm. During this time, William could not go to the art studio as it was closed. Hence, we can ignore the rest of this time range.\n\nStep 4: Check Nancy's observation. Nancy saw William buying a bike from 8pm to 10pm. Since William could have gone to the art studio before the bike purchase (only between 8pm and 10pm remain), and the art studio was closed at 10pm, William could only have gone during the time range of:\n  8pm to 10pm                             (During this time range)\n\nSince there are no overlaps or conflicting constraints, William's available time window is between 8pm and 10pm.
