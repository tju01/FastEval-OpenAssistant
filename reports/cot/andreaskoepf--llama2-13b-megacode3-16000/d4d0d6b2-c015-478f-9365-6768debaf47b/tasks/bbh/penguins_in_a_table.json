James, 12, 90, 12\n\nNow let's compare the height and weight of each penguin to answer the question:\n\nWe are looking for the penguin who is 60 cm tall. The penguin's height is mentioned in centimeters in each line, so we can compare it with the given height of 60.\n\nComputing:\n\n2 - Bernard, 80\n3 - Vincent, 90\n4 - Gwen, 70\n5 - James, 90\n\nAll of these penguins are taller than 60 cm, so they are not our answer. Now we will proceed to answer the question:\n\n6 - Louis, 50\n\nAs soon as I see Louis's height (50 cm) is less than 60 cm, I have immediately identified the answer to your question as:\n\n(A) Louis\n\nThe penguin who is 60 cm tall is Louis.",
