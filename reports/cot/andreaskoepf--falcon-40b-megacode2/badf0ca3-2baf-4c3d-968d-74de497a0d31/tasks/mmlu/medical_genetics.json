            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what a Robertsonian translocation is.\n\nA Robertsonian translocation is a type of chromosome rearrangement that occurs between two non-homologous chromosomes. It is a reciprocal translocation, meaning that the same segment of material is exchanged between the chromosomes. In humans, these translocations often involve chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22, but other combinations can occur as well.\n\nNow let's identify the correct answer among the given options by analyzing each step of the process:\n\n(A) Telomeres are protective structures at the ends of chromosomes that prevent them from deteriorating or fusing with other chromosomes.\n\n(B) Centromeres are the regions in the middle of a chromosome that help separate the two spindle fibers during cell division.\n\n(C) Histones are proteins that package DNA into structures called nucleosomes, allowing the long DNA molecule to fit into the cell nucleus.\n\n(D) Ends of the long arms refer to the telomeres at the end of each chromosome's long arm.\n\nConsidering the information above, the correct response to the question is:\n\n(D) ends of the long arms.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's go through each option and evaluate whether \"Zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins are\" the mentioned category:\n\n(A) types of DNA-binding proteins\n\nFirst, let's examine what zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins do:\n\n1. Zinc finger proteins: These proteins contain one or more zinc finger motifs, which are involved in DNA recognition and binding. Zinc finger motifs are small, modular protein-protein interaction domains that are ~30 residues long and contain one or more zinc ions coordinated by cysteine and histidine residues. They recognize and bind specific DNA sequences, and they are present in various transcription factors \u2013 proteins that help regulate gene expression by interacting with specific DNA sequences in the promoter region of genes.\n\n2. Helix-turn-helix proteins: These proteins are a class of transcription factors, also known as eukaryotic regulatory proteins or HTH proteins. \"Helix-turn-helix\" refers to the structural motifs found in their DNA-binding domains, which consist of one or more helix-turn-helix repeats. These repeats consist of two alpha helical segments connected by a flexible turn, allowing them to form DNA recognition and binding sites. Helix-turn-helix proteins also play a significant role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences.\n\nBased on this information, both zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins are part of the DNA-binding family of proteins. Therefore, the correct choice in this case is:\n\n(A) types of DNA-binding proteins",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To find the expected frequency of affected females in a population with a given frequency of affected males, we need to consider that the condition is X-linked recessive. This means that the affected males are necessarily homozygous, i.e., they carry two copies of the recessive allele.\n\nSince the condition is X-linked recessive, females are either homozygous (affected) or heterozygous (carrying one normal and one affected allele). These females are referred to as carriers. To calculate the expected frequency of affected females, we will consider three possibilities:\n\n1. Affected females are homozygous.\n2. Affected females are carriers.\n3. Affected females are a mix of both homozygous and heterozygous females.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the frequency of affected females who are homozygous.\nFrequency of affected males = 0.10 (1 in 10)\nFrequency of affected males who are homozygous = 1 (due to the nature of X-linked recessive conditions)\nFrequency of homozygous affected females = Frequency of affected males who are homozygous * Frequency of females with hemizygous males = 1 * 1 = 1 (there are no affected females among the general population, so this factor is 1)\n\nStep 2: Estimate the frequency of affected females who are carriers.\nFrequency of heterozyous females = 1 (due to the general population, and the fact that the frequency of carriers is expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium)\nFrequency of homozygous males = 0.10 (due to the nature of X-linked recessive conditions)\nFrequency of affected heterozygous females = Frequency of heterozygous females * Frequency of males with hemizygous males = 1 * 0.10 \u2248 1/10 (approximately one in ten affected heterozygous females are carriers)\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total frequency of affected females by summing frequencies from Steps 1 and 2.\nFrequency of affected females = Frequency of homozygous affected females + Frequency of heterozygous affected females = 1 + (1/10) \u2248 2.1 (approximately two and a tenth)\nFrequency of affected females = (2.1) \u00d7 (10) = 21 (approximately)\n\nHowever, only whole numbers are allowed for the answer options, and the closest whole number to 21 is 20. Therefore, the answer we are looking for is among the options we have.\n\n(A) 0.01 = No\n(B) 0.001 = No\n(C) 0.02 \u2248 Correct (20 in 100)\n(D) 0.0001 = No\n\nSo based on our step-by-step reasoning, the expected frequency of affected females in this population would be approximately 20 in 100 (Option C).",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's consider the structure of DNA and how the nucleotide bases pair together based on their chemical properties. \n\nStep 1: Understand the structure of DNA. \nDNA is composed of two strands that run in opposite directions. These strands are made up of nucleotide bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). The bases always pair in a specific way, forming the structure of the DNA double helix. \n\nStep 2: Recognize complementary base pairs.\nAdenine pairs with thymine (A-T), and guanine pairs with cytosine (G-C). These complementary pairs result from the chemical properties of the bases, such as the ability of adenine and thymine to form two hydrogen bonds and guanine and cytosine to form three hydrogen bonds. \n\nStep 3: Identify the correct answer based on the information gathered.\nThe question asks which nucleotide adenine normally pairs with in DNA. Based on the information gathered in the previous steps, we know that adenine pairs with thymine (A-T). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) thymine.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the pattern of inheritance for malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia), we need to consider the different types of genetic disorders that can be inherited. There are several modes of inheritance, including:\n\n(A) autosomal dominant: An individual can inherit a single copy of the mutated gene, either from the mother or the father, and have a chance to develop the disorder.\n\n(B) autosomal recessive: An individual needs to inherit two mutated copies of the same gene, one from each parent, to develop the disorder.\n\n(C) X-linked dominant: The gene responsible for the disorder is located on the X chromosome, and females have two X chromosomes. Since males only have one X chromosome, they have a higher chance of developing the disorder if they inherit the mutated gene.\n\n(D) X-linked recessive: The gene responsible for the disorder is also on the X chromosome, and only males who inherit the mutated gene from their mother will develop the disorder.\n\nNow, let's analyze malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia):\n\n1. Malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia) is a rare, potentially life-threatening condition that can be triggered by certain drugs used during anesthesia.\n\n2. This condition involves an abnormal increase in body temperature, usually due to a mutation in the RYR1 gene, which plays a key role in muscle function and calcium regulation.\n\n3. Offspring of affected individuals have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene, typically from an affected parent.\n\nBased on this information, the correct pattern of inheritance for malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia) is:\n\n(C) X-linked dominant, as it is triggered by a mutation in the RYR1 gene located on the X chromosome.",

Human chromosome mapping has not been restricted to the sex chromosomes exclusively. It has involved mapping all chromosomes, not just the sex chromosomes.\n\n(B) This statement is true. The development of more sophisticated technologies, such as DNA microarrays and next-generation sequencing techniques, has allowed for the successful mapping of human chromosomes. As we gained access to a larger number of DNA markers, the process of mapping has become easier and more successful.\n\n(C) This statement is not accurate. The number of linkage groups is not determined by the number of chromosomes. Linkage groups are formed by close association of linked genes during meiosis, and their number can vary.\n\n(D) This statement is not universally true.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Exon skipping is a process that occurs during the production of messenger RNA (mRNA). In this process, certain parts of a gene, known as exons, are spliced together to create a mature mRNA molecule, while the noncoding introns are removed. This mechanism is important for controlling gene expression and ensuring that the proper protein is synthesized.\n\nLet's evaluate the answer choices step-by-step:\n\n(A) Nonsense mutations: These are genetic mutations where a premature stop codon is introduced into the mRNA, which leads to the production of a truncated protein or a nonfunctional protein. However, nonsense mutations do not cause exon skipping, so this cannot be the correct answer.\n\n(B) Regulatory mutations: Regulatory mutations may impact gene expression or the overall functioning of a gene. These mutations can occur in both the coding and noncoding regions of a gene and may include polymorphisms or structural variations. In the case of exon skipping, regulatory mutations could potentially influence the splicing pattern if they occur in relevant regulatory elements. This seems like a possible answer.\n\n(C) RNA processing mutations: RNA processing mutations are genetic variations that result in altered RNA processing events such as splicing or ribosome binding. Since exon skipping is a form of RNA processing, mutations in RNA processing might be directly responsible for exon skipping. This is a likely answer.\n\n(D) Silent mutations: Silent mutations refer to nucleotide changes that occur within a gene but do not result in an alteration of the protein sequence. Such mutations typically occur in the third codon positions and can be synonymous or nonsynonymous depending on their effect on the amino acid. Silent mutations may affect RNA processing in some cases but are not directly related to exon skipping. This option does not fit as a correct answer.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the answer to the question is:\n\n(C) RNA processing mutations.",
