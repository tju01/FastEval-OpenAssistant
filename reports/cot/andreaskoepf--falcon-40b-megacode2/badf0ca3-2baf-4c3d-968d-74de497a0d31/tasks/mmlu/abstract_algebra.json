            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we must find all the zeros of the given polynomial by allowing all possible values of the variable x within the finite field Z_5, and then evaluate the polynomial at those points. \n\nThe polynomial in question is x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x.\n\nOur first step is to rewrite this polynomial as a vector in the finite field Z_5. We do this since each term of the polynomial can be converted to the corresponding element in Z_5 by allowing all possible values of the variable x within the said finite field.\n\nNote that in Z_5, any element can be written as a vector in the form (a^0, a^1, a^2, a^3, a^4), where a is an element of the finite field Z_5 i.e., a = 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 (or any other element in Z_5). \n\nLet's call this polynomial vector as P.\n\nSo, P = (a^0, a^3, a^2, 2a, a^4)\n\nOur next step is to find all possible vectors in Z_5 that are equivalent to the zero vector. Remember that in Z_5, since each element has a unique equivalent vector, all possible vectors can be represented in the form of (a^0, a^1, a^2, a^3, a^4) because the only equivalent vector of the zero vector is the zero vector itself. \n\nNow let's evaluate the vector P at the points (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) in the finite field Z_5.\n\nP(0,1,2,3,4) = (a^0, a^3, a^2, 2a, a^4)(0, 1, 2, 3, 4) = 0\n\nSince the classifier function of the finite field Z_5 i.e., the function that decides if an element is in the field or not is x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x = 0, we can conclude that 0 is a zero of the vector P in the field Z_5.\n\nThe above classifier function also pertains to equivalent vector representation in the field. So, if P(0,1,2,3,4) = 0 then, any other representation of 0 within Z_5 equivalent vector representation would also classify as the zero of P. Thus, classifier function also pertains to equivalent vector representation in the field.\n\nNote that by allowing all possible values of the variable x within the said finite field, the results are also congruent classifier within Z_5. Hence, in the context of the results we already got, 0 is a zero of equivalent vector representation in the field Z_5.\n\nIn addition, within Z_5 equivalent vector representation, the classifier function can also be expressed by allowing all classifier within Z_5 equivalent vector representation in the classifier within the results we already got.

In a group, an element is considered non-Abelian if it cannot be expressed as a product of two conjugate elements. In other words, a group is non-Abelian if it contains at least one element that cannot be expressed in the form a^b, where a and b are conjugate elements. Since a factor group is a group obtained by dividing a group by one of its subgroups, the subgroup that is the kernel of a group homomorphism, it is possible for a non-Abelian group to have a non-Abelian factor group. \n\nStep 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 states that if K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G. A normal subgroup is a subgroup that is invariant under all conjugations and satisfies the property of having a normal inverse to its projection. A group G has a subgroup H as a normal subgroup if H is a subset of G that is invariant under conjugation and such that for each h in H, the set G \\ H (the coset in G of the subgroup H) is a union of conjugate subgroups of H. \n\nStep 3: Find the answer\nNow that we have analyzed both statements, let's determine which of the given options is the correct answer.\n\n(A) True, True: Statement 1 is True, and Statement 2 is True.

This option negates both statements, implying that neither statement is valid in group theory.\n\n(C) True, False: Statement 1 is True, and Statement 2 is False. This means that Statement 1 supports the fact that a factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian, but Statement 2 is negated, implying that K is not necessarily a normal subgroup of G just because K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G.\n\n(D) False, True: Statement 1 is False, and Statement 2 is True. This option means that Statement 1 negates the fact that a factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian, but Statement 2 supports the fact that a normal subgroup of H that is also a normal subgroup of G is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nAfter analyzing all options, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) True, True",

            "model_answer": "Let's find the degree of the given field extension step-by-step:\n\n1. The given field extension is Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)).\n2. We are asked to find the degree of this extension over Q.\n3. To start with, let's recall the meaning of degree in the context of field extensions:\n   - The degree of a field extension is the smallest positive integer such that any two distinct roots of a nonzero polynomial in the extension have a common factor of that degree.\n4. Now, we have to find distinct roots in the given extension.\n\nLet's check the possibilities:\nCase 1: The four possible algebraic combinations of the roots are:\n   a) (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))^2\n   b) (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) * (sqrt(2) - sqrt(3))\n   c) (sqrt(2) - sqrt(3)) * (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))\n   d) (sqrt(2) - sqrt(3))^2\n\nCase 2: The four possible algebraic combinations of the roots are:\n   a) (3sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))^2\n   b) (3sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) * (sqrt(2) - sqrt(2^2))\n   c) (sqrt(2) - sqrt(2^2)) * (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))\n   d) (sqrt(2) - sqrt(3))^2\n\n5. Comparing both cases, we see that there are no common roots with degree 2. Hence, the degree is at least 4.\n6. All distinct roots have four distinct algebraic combinations. However, since we are looking for the degree over Q, we have four more algebraic combinations:\n   - (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))^2\n   - (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) * (sqrt(2) - sqrt(3))\n   - (sqrt(2) - sqrt(3)) * (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))\n   - (sqrt(2) - sqrt(3))^2\n\n7. Now we have eight algebraic combinations of roots without any common factor other than the square of the degree.\n\nSince we have reached the point at which four more algebraic combinations are obtained, the degree is at most 4. Therefore, the degree of the given field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q is 4.\n\nThe answer is (B) 4.",

            "model_answer": "We are asked to find all the zeros of the polynomial x^3 + 2x + 2 in the finite field Z_7, where x is a variable.\n\nWe are given that this polynomial has 1, 2, 2, and 6 as possible zeros. We will find all the zeros and then match them with the given set of possible answers.\n\nTo find the zeros, we can use the Rational Root Theorem, which states that if the numerator of the polynomial divided by the denominator has only small prime factors, then the numerator will have a root in the finite field.\n\nWe will use trial division for the numerator and see if any of the remainders are in Z_7. The prime factors of Z_7 are 3 and 7.\n\nFollowing the trial division method, we will divide the numerator (x^3 + 2x + 2) by the prime factors of Z_7 (3 and 7). We get the following results:\n1. x^3 + x + 2: Remainder when divided by 3 = 2. x_0 = -2\n2. x^3 + x + x_0: Remainder when divided by 7 = 2. x_1 = -2\n3. x_0^3 + x_0 x_1 + x_2: Remainder when divided by 3 = x_2 = -2\n4. x_0^3 + x_0 x_1^2 + x_3: Remainder when divided by 7 = x_3 = -2\n5. x_0^3 + x_0 x_1 x_3^2 + x_4: Remainder when divided by 3 = x_4 = -2\nFollowing further trial division for x_4, we get x_4 = -2 as well. There are no more zeros after this step.\n\nLooking at the set of possible answers, we can find all the zeros match with the ones we found: x_0 = -2, x_1 = -2, x_2 = -2, x_3 = -2, and x_4 = -2.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n(C) 2, 3",
