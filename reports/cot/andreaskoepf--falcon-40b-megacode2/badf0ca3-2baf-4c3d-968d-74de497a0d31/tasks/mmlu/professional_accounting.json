            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to determine the hourly revenue if the limousine is rented for 2 hours a day on average. \n\nRevenue per day = (hours rented per day) x (hourly rate)\nRevenue per day = 2 hours/day x $245/hour = $490/day\n\nNext, we need to find the estimated yearly revenue by multiplying the daily revenue by the number of days in a year, considering both weekdays and weekends.\n\nEstimated yearly revenue = (daily revenue) x (days per year)\nEstimated yearly revenue = $490/day x 365 days = $176,220/year\n\nNow, we need to calculate the estimated yearly yield on the investment, which is the estimated yearly revenue divided by the initial investment.\n\nEstimated yearly yield = (estimated yearly revenue) / (initial investment)\nEstimated yearly yield = $176,220/year / $98,000 = 1.8039\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the answer becomes 1.81. \n\nLooking at the answer choices, the closest option to 1.81 is (B) 1.64%.

This option addresses nonsampling risk, i.e., a risk arising from not testing the entire population. This option is likely correct as it focuses on a risk affecting audit sampling specifically.\n\n \n(B) Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.\nWhile this may have some relevance to audit quality, it does not address the context of audit sampling risks for a nonissuer. It does not directly relate to the risks of using a sample, so it's less likely to be the correct answer.\n\n \n(C) Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.\nThis option is too general and does not specifically address the context of audit sampling risks for a nonissuer. Sampling risk may be present in various situations, but it doesn't focus on the specific risks of audit sampling. Therefore, it's less likely to be the correct answer.\n\n \n(D) Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.\nAlthough this option addresses sampling risks, it focuses on the incorrect selection of audit procedures.

            "model_answer": "Let's analyze each option step by step and determine which one best fits the definition of procedures an auditor would generally perform regarding subsequent events:\n\n(A) Inspect inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end: This option concerns inventory transactions that occur after the year end. These transactions would typically be recorded in the subsequent period, not the period being audited. Therefore, this option isn't likely to relate to procedures regarding subsequent events.\n\n(B) Test internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate: This option focuses on internal controls and their adequacy, but it doesn't inherently relate to procedures performed specifically regarding subsequent events. Instead, this option aligns more with general audit procedure steps such as assessing risk and control environments.\n\n(C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end: This option involves examining the bank statements up to several months after the year end. This activity may help verify transactions that occurred post-year end, but it doesn't necessarily address procedures relating specifically to subsequent events.\n\n(D) Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited: This option aligns with comparing financial statements, identifying changes, and assessing their impact. It falls under the general auditing procedure step of assessing and verifying financial statement activities.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the best fitting procedure is:\n\n(D) Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand the concepts of amortization and the methods used. Then, we will analyze the effect of the error on the bond's carrying amount, retained earnings, and bond earnings. Finally, we will decide the overall effect on the amount.\n\nStep 1: Understand amortization and methods\nAmortization is the allocation of the cost of a bond issue over a period of time through the use of an amortization schedule. There are two main methods: straight-line method and the effective interest method. In the straight-line method, the bond discounts and premium are evenly spread over the entire term of the bond, whereas the effective interest method discounts the bond's cash flows taking into account the time value of money.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the error in the straight-line method\nDean Co. used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method. This means that the bond premium was not discounted properly, resulting in an inaccuracy in the calculated amortization. The bond premium is an upfront fee, and it should be accounted for by decreasing the bond's carrying amount or increasing its retained earnings, rather than spreading the premium as an expense like in the straight-line method.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the effect on the bond's carrying amount, retained earnings, and bond earnings\nConsidering that the bond premium is not properly accounted for when using the straight-line method, we can conclude the following:\n- The bond's carrying amount will be overstated because, in reality, the company holds bond assets that are worth less than what they are carrying on their books. \n- The retained earnings will be understated because the company should have increased the retained earnings by the bond premium, but instead, they remain as part of the bond's carrying amount. \n- The bond earnings will be understated because the bond premium should have been treated as a non-cash expense, reducing the bond's cost, thus increasing the bond earnings.\n\nStep 4: Determine the overall effect on the amounts\nSince the bond carrying amount, retained earnings, and bond earnings are all affected negatively by the straight-line method error, we can say that the overall effect is that the amounts are overstated.\n\nStep 5: Output the final answer\nThe correct answer is (A) Overstated.",

The company has moved to a new building, which means the old building is no longer being used for their operations.\n2. The old building is actively being marketed for sale, indicating that the company is in the process of selling it.\n3. The company expects to complete the sale in four months, meaning the sale transaction hasn't closed yet.\n\nNow, let's look at the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to determine the appropriate classification and treatment of assets:\n\n1. Current Assets - These are assets that a company expects to utilize or convert into cash within a year or the company's operating cycle, whichever is longer. These assets include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and short-term investments.\n\n2. Non-Current Assets (Formally known as Fixed Assets or Property, Plant, and Equipment) - These assets are expected to remain in a company for more than a year and are utilized to generate revenues. They include land, buildings, furniture, equipment, machinery, intangible assets, and investments in related companies or securities.\n\n3. Assets Held for Sale - These are assets that a company holds but is in the process of selling and can be reasonably expected to be sold within a reasonable period.\n\nIn light of this information, let's return to the statements and analyze them:\n\n(A) It will be reclassified as an asset held for sale - This statement is correct because the old building is actively being marketed for sale. As per GAAP, the building should be reclassified as an asset held for sale.\n\n(B) It will be classified as a current asset - This statement is incorrect because the old building is no longer being used for operations, and the company is in the process of selling it. Assets held for sale are not considered current assets.\n\n(C) It will no longer be depreciated - This statement is a consequence of the building being reclassified as an asset held for sale. Depreciation stops when an asset is classified as held for sale.\n\n(D) It will be valued at historical cost - This statement is also incorrect because the valuation of assets held for sale is typically based on their fair market value (FMV), not historical cost. The FMV represents the price that the asset could be sold for on the open market.\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) It will be classified as a current asset.",
