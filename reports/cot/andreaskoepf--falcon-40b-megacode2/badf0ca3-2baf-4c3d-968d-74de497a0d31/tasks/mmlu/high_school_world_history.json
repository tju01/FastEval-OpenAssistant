            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's go through the information provided step by step and evaluate each option in relation to the passage:\n\n1. Read and understand the passage: The passage talks about preserving peace, the importance of independence, and rehabilitating countries. It discusses using reason, spiritual strength, moral strength, and political strength to promote peace. Moreover, it mentions that Sukarno, an Indonesian leader, delivered this speech at the Bandung Conference in 1955. The speech focused on bringing together the people of Asia and Africa in support of peace.\n\n2. Evaluate each option in relation to the passage:\n\n(A) The formation of the non-aligned movement: The passage mentions the importance of preserving peace and upholding independence, and it showcases a call for unity among people of Asia and Africa in support of peace. This idea resonates with the formation of the non-aligned movement, which aimed to promote peace and independence among non-aligned nations. Thus, this option could be relevant.\n\n(B) Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation: The passage does not directly mention disarmament or nuclear non-proliferation, so this option is less likely to be the correct answer.\n\n(C) The Green Revolution in agriculture: The passage nowhere discusses agriculture or the Green Revolution, so this option is not relevant.\n\n(D) Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology: The passage highlights the unity of Asia and Africa and the need for peace, but it does not specifically discuss pan-Asian ideology. Although it contains elements that might be associated with pan-Asian ideology, it is not the most prominent theme in the passage, which makes it less likely the correct answer.\n\n3. Determine the most relevant option:\n\nUpon evaluating each option, the most relevant option is (A) The formation of the non-aligned movement as it best represents the main idea of the passage: preserving peace, promoting unity, and standing against aggression and injustice for the sake of independence and rehabilitation of nations.\n\nAnswer: (A) The formation of the non-aligned movement",

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value.

            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze the information available in the passage to find any relevant evidence that supports Ghanians being engaged in trade with Asia.\n\nWe can see that:\n\n- There are wells with sweet water around the city, allowing agriculture to grow.\n- The king's interpreters, treasury official, and many ministers are Muslims.\n- The king wears necklaces and bracelets, showing a possible access to precious stones and metals.\n- People pay taxes on goods imported to the country, such as salt, copper, and other goods. Additionally, gold nuggets are reserved for the king, and gold dust is left for the people. This reveals an interest in gold and possibly other valuable resources.\n- There is information about the king of Malal and his people having connections with Islam, which has spread to Ghanian rulers, indicating some exchange of ideas and possibly goods between regions.\n\nNow, let's go through each option to see if there is any evidence supporting the claim that Ghanians were engaged, directly or indirectly, in trade with Asia:\n\n(A) The presence of horses in their court does not indicate trade specifically with Asia, as horses could be obtained from various regions, not just Asia.\n\n(B) The Ghanian king had adopted the Chinese tradition of the kow-tow is not supported by the passage. There is no mention of the king performing any kow-tow or being influenced by Chinese traditions.\n\n(C) The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India could be a possibility, as gold and jewels are mentioned as valuable resources in the country, and India has long had a history of trading these items.\n\n(D) The people in his court wore silk robes; however, without any information about the origin of the silk or how it was obtained, it's not strong evidence for trade.\n\nBased on these observations, the most plausible evidence about Ghanians being engaged, directly or indirectly, in trade with Asia can be attributed to:\n\n(C) The king adorning himself with gold and jewels, probably from India.",

In order to answer this question correctly, let's first break down the information provided: Colonel Bonesteel wanted to establish a surrender zone in Korea as far north as the Soviets would accept. Bonesteel believed the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. The Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea or were already there. The 38th parallel was chosen as a line for the zones in which Japanese forces would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can deduce the following:\n\n(A) They became a part of Japan\u2019s territory. This is incorrect because the events focused on dividing Korea into zones for the surrender of Japanese forces, which implies the end of Japanese rule over Korea.\n(B) The Americans established freedom for all Koreans. This statement is also incorrect as the information provided only mentions the establishment of surrender zones for Japanese forces and dividing the zones between American and Soviet authorities. There is no mention of freedom for Koreans.\n(C) The Korean economy never recovered. This statement is not supported by the information given. The information focuses on military strategy and the establishment of surrender zones, not on the economic recovery of Korea.\n(D) Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel. This answer is correct because the events described involve the establishment of surrender zones along the 38th parallel, which eventually led to the division of Korea into North Korea and South Korea.\n\nSo the answer is (D) Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel.",

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.
