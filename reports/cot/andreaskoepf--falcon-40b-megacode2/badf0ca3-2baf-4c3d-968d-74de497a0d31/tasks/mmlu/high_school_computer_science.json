            "model_answer": "To solve this task step by step, we first need to explain what bitwise left shift operator (<<) does in Python 3.\n\n1. Understand the bitwise left shift operator (<<):\n\nIn Python 3, the bitwise left shift operator (<<) shifts each bit of the binary representation of the number to the left by a certain number of positions. It multiplies the number by 2 raised to the power of the number of positions shifted.\n\n2. Apply the bitwise left shift operator to x = 1:\n\nSince x = 1, we perform a bitwise left shift by 3 positions (which means multiplying by 2^3). \n\nx = 1\nx << 3 = 1 * 2^3 = 8\n\nSo, after shifting x by 3 positions, the result is 8.\n\n3. Match the result with the given options:\n\nNow that we have the result, we can see which option it corresponds to:\n\n(A) 1\n(B) 3\n(C) 8\n(D) 16\n\nThe result 8 is listed in option (C).\n\nThus, the final answer is (C) 8.",

            "question": "Digital images are often represented by the red, green, and blue values (an RGB triplet) of each individual pixel in the image.

The new value of each pixel represents a shade of gray, ranging from white to black.\n(C) Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255. The negative of an image is reversed from the original; light areas appear dark, and colors are reversed.\n(D) Modifying part of the image by taking the pixels in one part of the picture and copying them to the pixels in another part of the picture.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, we will analyze each option to determine whether it describes a lossless transformation of the digital image.\n\n(A) Compressing the image: Lossless compression can be achieved through methods like PNG or WebP, which preserve image quality at the expense of file size. This is a lossless transformation because it allows for exact reconstruction of the original image from the compressed file without any loss of quality.\n\n(B) Creating a grayscale image: Converting an RGB image to grayscale involves calculating a weighted average of the red, green, and blue values in each pixel, giving each pixel a single grayscale value. The resulting image has the same number of pixels as the original but fewer components. This can be considered a lossless transformation since all the information from the original image is preserved.\n\n(C) Creating the negative of an image: Inverting the values in an RGB triplet for each pixel, i.e. subtracting the original value from 255, creates a new triple with the same structure as the original. This still involves three values for each pixel and preserves the spatial information. Therefore, this can be considered a lossless transformation.\n\n(D) Modifying part of the image: In this scenario, the photographer copies pixels from one part of the image to another. This involves changing the values of some pixels but not necessarily preserving the original structure or meaning of the data. Since it modifies the image without retaining all of the original information, this option is not a lossless transformation.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (B), creating the gray scale of an image, is the most appropriate answer as it preserves the original structure and information. Option (C), creating the negative of an image, could be considered as well since it also maintains the original structure while inverting the color values. Option (A), although lossless, does not describe a transformation of the original image, and option (D) involves modifying the image, which is not lossless.",

            "model_answer": "First, to answer this question, let's consider each option:\n\n(A) How long the program takes to run:\nProcessing larger data sets often take longer to execute. However, this depends on the efficiency of the code, use of parallel processing, and available resources. Therefore, the time it takes for the program to run may be affected by larger data sets.\n\n(B) How many programming statements the program contains:\nMore programming statements do not directly affect the ability to process larger data sets if the code is well optimized. A more efficient algorithm and optimized code can still process large datasets even with more statements.\n\n(C) How much memory the program requires as it runs:\nProcessing larger data sets can require more memory. The program may need to store and process the data, and therefore, might need dynamic memory allocation. Lack of memory can hinder the ability to process larger data sets.\n\n(D) How much storage space the program requires as it runs:\nStorage space required can depend on the data being processed. If the data is very large, the program may need more storage during runtime. However, this depends on how the data is stored and operated upon within the program.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n(A) How long the program takes to run: Least likely to affect the ability of the program to process larger data sets.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

A two-digit hexadecimal number can be represented as an integer between 10 and 99 (inclusive).\n2. In base-10, these integers represent the following base-10 values:\n   - 10 (A) - 10\n   - 11 (B) - 11\n   - ...\n   - 39 (A) - 39\n   - 40 (B) - 40\n   - ...\n   - 90 (F) - 90\n   - 91 (A) - 91\n   - 92 (B) - 92\n   - ...\n   - 99 (F) - 99\n\n3. We need to find the largest integer value that can be represented with a two-digit hexadecimal number. However, since both digits of the hexadecimal number can have either a 0 or a 1 in them, we have 16 possible two-digit hexadecimal numbers (00 to FF). This greatly increases the range of possible integers we can represent compared to base-10.\n\n4.

The instructions have to be written in a language that can be understood by the computer. That language is typically a programming language.

While it is not a programming language itself, a program can be translated into binary code, letting the computer understand and execute the instructions contained within the binary code. This part is also true.\n\nPart #3: A higher-level programming language is used to reduce likelihood of errors.\nUsage: While binary code can be used to perform tasks directly, it is more likely to have errors due to its low-level nature.

A higher-level programming language, on the other hand, is more understandable for humans and reduces the likelihood of committing errors.
