            "model_answer": "To determine the appropriate size of cannula for a rapid blood transfusion, we need to consider a few factors.\n\nStep 1: Consider the patient's vein size and condition\nStep 2: Evaluate the size and type of blood vessels involved in the transfusion\nStep 3: Assess how quickly the blood transfusion is needed\nStep 4: Determine suitable cannula sizes based on the factors above\n\nNow let's consider the factors:\n\nStep 1: Patient's vein size and condition\nA rapid blood transfusion implies that a larger vein, capable of handling a higher flow rate, might be preferred to ensure a swift transfusion.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the size and type of blood vessels involved in the transfusion\nBlood transfusions typically involve accessing a large vein (e.g., a central vein, such as the median cubital vein) and sometimes use arterial lines for high-flow transfusions. However, since we are considering a rapid blood transfusion, a large vein would be the most important factor.\n\nStep 3: Assess how quickly the blood transfusion is needed\nThe speed of transfusion will depend on the patient's condition and the urgency of the transfusion. If the transfusion is required within minutes to save a patient's life, the cannula size should be optimized for a rapid flow rate.\n\nStep 4: Determine suitable cannula sizes based on the factors above\n18 gauge (A) is the most commonly used size for rapid blood transfusions due to its larger diameter, which allows for a faster flow rate of blood compared to smaller gauge sizes (20-24 gauge).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) 18 gauge.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the key attribute in successful marathon running, we need to consider each of the given options and assess their importance for long-distance running.\n\nOption A: Strength\nStrength can be crucial in running, as it helps with maintaining proper running form. Strong muscles and a stable core are important for avoiding injuries and maintaining efficiency.\n\nOption B: Power\nPower can be important in running, especially during short sprints or when moving uphill. However, power might not be as vital for long-distance running as for shorter distances.\n\nOption C: Stride length\nStride length refers to the distance between one foot's landing and the next foot's landing. Longer stride lengths can result in increased speed, which might be helpful in shorter races. However, maintaining an efficient stride for the duration of a marathon is more important than having a particularly long stride.\n\nOption D: Stamina\nStamina is the most important attribute for successful marathon running. Stamina refers to one's ability to endure long periods of physical exertion. As marathons are long-distance races, a runner must have very high levels of stamina to avoid getting fatigued early on and maintain a consistent pace until the very end of the race.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, it is clear that the key attribute in successful marathon running is stamina (D).",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we should first understand the meaning of anaphylaxis and then evaluate each option to determine which is NOT a symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\nStep 1: Define anaphylaxis\nAnaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs suddenly and affects multiple body systems. It can lead to difficulty in breathing, a drop in blood pressure, swelling, rashes, and in some cases, loss of consciousness.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each option\n\n(A) Stridor - Stridor refers to a high-pitched, noisy breathing sound caused by an obstruction in the airways. This could be a symptom of anaphylaxis, as anaphylactic reactions can cause swelling in the throat and airways.\n\n(B) Bradycardia - Bradycardia is a slow heart rate, typically below 60 beats per minute. During an anaphylactic reaction, it's possible for the heart rate to slow due to the release of certain chemicals, which can lead to a drop in blood pressure. Thus, bradycardia could be a symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\n(C) Severe wheeze - Severe wheeze, which refers to a whistling or squeaky sound during breathing, often due to narrowed airways, can be a symptom of anaphylaxis. Anaphylactic reactions often cause swelling in the airways, which can lead to wheezing.\n\n(D) Rash - While a rash can be a sign of an allergic reaction, it's not specific to anaphylaxis and can be seen in a wide range of mild to severe allergic reactions.\n\nBased on our analysis, it's clear that (D) Rash is NOT a symptom that's specific to anaphylaxis, while the other three options can be seen in anaphylactic reactions.\n\nSo, to answer the question, the answer is:\n\nD",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's consider the main energy pathways involved during physical activity, specifically focusing on muscle contractions during sprints.\n\n(A) Anaerobic contribution progressively increases during sprints:\n\nSprints are high-intensity, short-duration exercises where the energy demand is high. Initially, during the first few seconds of sprinting, the energy demands are met through ATP (adenosine triphosphate) stores and by tapping into the anaerobic pathways (glycolysis) to generate ATP rapidly. As the exercise continues, anaerobic contribution moderately decreases, and the aerobic pathway becomes the main contributor. However, there will still be some anaerobic contribution during the sprint.\n\n(B) pH of the muscle falls below 6.0 during sprints:\n\nThe pH of muscle is maintained around 7.0 in a resting state. Although lactic acid does accumulate during intense exercise like sprinting, the blood serves as a buffer to minimize any sharp changes in muscle pH. Thus, the pH of the muscle does not generally fall below 6.0 during sprints.\n\n(C) Blood glucose concentration falls below 3 mmol/L during sprints:\n\nBlood glucose levels decrease during physical activity due to the utilization of glucose molecules by muscle cells. However, as sprints are short in duration, the decrease in blood glucose is moderate and usually not below 3 mmol/L. The body has mechanisms to maintain blood glucose levels within a limited range to ensure adequate energy supply to the brain and muscle cells.\n\n(D) Relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases during sprints:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, during the initial seconds of sprinting, ATP stores are utilized, and the glycolysis is tapping into anaerobic pathways. As muscle contractions continue, the aerobic pathway (oxidative metabolism or the Krebs cycle) becomes increasingly significant in producing energy. Aerobic metabolism contributes more significantly as the sprint duration extends.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n(D) Relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Let's analyze each option step-by-step to find out which of the following statements is true in diplopia:\n\n(A) Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered: \nDiplopia refers to double vision caused by various reasons such as misalignment of the eyes (strabismus), unequal refractive errors, or neurological problems. If one eye is covered, the brain only receives visual input from the uncovered eye, so the diplopia due to misalignment or refractive errors is masked as the brain only processes information from a single eye. However, if diplopia is due to neurological issues, it still may be noticeable with one eye covered as the brain is still receiving conflicting information from the affected eye. So, option A is not true always.\n\n(B) The outer image is always the false image:\nDiplopia is the perception of two images, one from each eye, appearing at the same time in the visual field. The outer image, also known as the nasal image (from the right eye) and the temporal image (from the left eye) of the fixation point in people with normal binocular vision, is slightly displaced from the inner image (foveal image) due to the eye's optics and eye misalignment. However, the outer image is considered \"false\" only in certain conditions like strabismus or tropias, but in people with normal binocular vision, both images are considered real and contribute to a 3D perception. Therefore, option B is not true always.\n\n(C) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards:\nA fourth nerve palsy, also known as superior oblique palsy, refers to the paralysis of the superior oblique muscle, which controls eye movement during vertical eye movements (looking up, down, and horizontal gaze with slight up or down deviation). While people with fourth nerve palsy may have double vision when looking upwards, it is not a definitive finding in fourth nerve palsy. Therefore, looking upwards is not the only condition for diagnosing a fourth nerve palsy. So, option C is not true always.\n\n(D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint:\nA sixth nerve palsy, also known as abducens nerve palsy, affects the lateral rectus muscle, which is responsible for eye movement to the side. A sixth nerve palsy typically results in double vision, with the affected eye being deviated inwards (inward squint) and inability to adduct the eye (eye turning inwards). So, a sixth nerve palsy does cause divergent squint (outward deviation of the affected eye). Therefore, option D is true.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the statement that is true in diplopia is:\nD",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question and identify the effects of sodium bicarbonate ingestion on middle-distance running performance.\n\nStep 2: Recall the physical and chemical properties of sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) is a compound with the formula NaHCO3. It is alkaline and upon dissolving in water or stomach fluid, it increases the pH of the solution.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each of the options based on the properties of sodium bicarbonate and effects on muscle performance:\n\n(A) Elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allows a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle. - This is possible because an increased pH creates an environment where hydrogen ions (H+) are less concentrated. As a result, these ions can be removed from the muscle more efficiently due to the increased buffering capacity of the fluid. This effect is beneficial for muscle function, as it reduces the acidosis that occurs during high-intensity exercise.\n\n(B) Reducing the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle - This is not consistent with the properties of sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate is an alkaline compound, and upon dissolving in solution, it increases the pH, not decreases it. Additionally, it increases the buffering capacity of the fluid, allowing for a more efficient removal of hydrogen ions, not less. This option is incorrect.\n\n(C) Elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster influx of hydrogen ions into muscle - This is not consistent with the properties of sodium bicarbonate. Remember, sodium bicarbonate increases the buffering capacity, not attracts hydrogen ions back into the muscle. The increased buffering capacity allows for a more efficient removal of hydrogen ions, not import them back into the muscle. This option is incorrect.\n\n(D) Elevating the pre-exercise muscle pH - Similar to option A, this option is consistent with the properties of sodium bicarbonate. By dissolving in water, sodium bicarbonate increases the pH of the fluid, and since the muscle cells are in an isotonic solution with the fluid, the increased pH would affect the cells as well. While this effect is not as prominent as options A and B due to the temporary nature of increased pH, it is still a plausible effect of sodium bicarbonate ingestion.\n\nTo summarize, the best option based on the properties of sodium bicarbonate and their effects on middle-distance running performance is:\n\n(A) Elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.",

The question asks us to find the molecule that fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria bound to.\n2. To better understand the answer choices, we need to know some basic concepts about fatty acid metabolism:\n\n   a. Fatty acids are activated in the cytoplasm to form fatty acyl-CoAs by the action of an enzyme called acyl-CoA synthase.\n   b. These fatty acyl-CoAs are transported into the mitochondria, where they are used in the citric acid cycle.\n   c. Fatty acyl-CoAs are converted to acyl carnitines with the help of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) before they are transported into the mitochondria.\n\n3. Now let's evaluate each answer choice based on these concepts:\n\n   a. (A) Thiokinase: This is an enzyme term that is not directly related to fatty acid metabolism. So this option is less likely.\n   b. (B) Coenzyme A (CoA): CoA is involved in fatty acid metabolism as mentioned above, but it acts in the cytoplasm where fatty acids are activated, not in the mitochondria where they are transported. So this option is less likely.\n   c. (C) Acetyl-CoA: Although this molecule is formed when fatty acids are converted to fatty acyl-CoAs in the cytoplasm, it is not directly involved in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria. So this option is less likely.\n   d. (D) Carnitine: This molecule plays an important role in transporting activated fatty acyl-CoAs into the mitochondria. It binds to fatty acyl-CoAs to form acyl carnitines, which can be taken up by the mitochondria. Therefore, this is the most plausible answer.\n\nSo the answer to the question is (D) carnitine.",
