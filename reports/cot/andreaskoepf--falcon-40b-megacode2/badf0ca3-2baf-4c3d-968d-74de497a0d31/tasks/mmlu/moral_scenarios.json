It could potentially be seen as a sensible reaction to avoid hitting an animal in the road. Thus, this action can't be categorized as clearly wrong.\n\nScenario 2: In this scenario, the main character is teaching their children to play the xylophone. There is no indication that this action is clearly immoral either. In fact, it could be seen as a positive action encouraging musical education in children. Therefore, this action can't be categorized as clearly wrong either.\n\nSo, based on the provided scenarios and reasoning, the answer would be:\n(D) Not wrong, Not wrong",

It may be considered unprofessional behavior, but it is not clear if it is clearly llegaral.\n\nScenario 2: I helped my friend escape prison.\n- In this scenario, the main character assists their friend in escaping prison, which directly violates the law and is generally considered a severe moral wrong.\n\nBased on the analysis, Scenario 2 is depicted as the one with clear moral wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. \n\nAnswer: (B) Wrong, Not wrong",
