            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(A) The United States was granted the territory in a postwar treaty with France. \n\nThe reasoning for this answer is based on the historical context surrounding the Oregon Territory. In the late 18th century, the territory was explored and claimed by both British and American interests. The British claimed it through the explorations of Captain James Cook, while the American claim came from the Lewis and Clark expedition, which was authorized by the United States government. \n\nThe War of 1812 (lasting from 1812 to 1815) between the United States and Britain led to the Treaty of Ghent, which was signed on December 24, 1814. Among other provisions, this treaty established a temporary joint occupation of the Oregon Territory by British and American settlers, with a clear boundary between the territories, known as the \"49th Parallel.\" \n\nNeither nation was willing to abandon their claims on the territory, so in 1818, the United States and Britain agreed upon the Oregon Treaty, also known as the Treaty of 1818. This treaty established the 49th Parallel as the international boundary between British North America (later Canada) and the United States, confirming American possession of the Oregon Territory.\n\nConsidering the events that took place before and during this time, it can be deduced that the United States took possession of the Oregon Territory through a postwar treaty with France (Answer A).",

Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.

Board of Education, 1954\nDesegregation of schools was, in part, a response to unfulfilled promises from which of the following initiatives?\n\n(A) The Great Society\n(B) The Square Deal\n(C) The New Deal\n(D) Reconstruction",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first break down the information provided and understand the context:\n\nThe question refers to the Brown v. Board of Education case from 1954, which ruled that separate but equal facilities in public education were inherently unequal. This means that segregated schools were not providing equal protection under the law, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nNow, let's analyze the multiple-choice options:\n\n(A) The Great Society: This was an initiative by President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960s, focusing on domestic issues such as civil rights, healthcare, education, and poverty. While it aimed at improving the lives of all Americans, it wasn't specifically targeting desegregation of schools.\n\n(B) The Square Deal: This was an initiative by President Theodore Roosevelt at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century. It focused on social and economic reforms, especially regulating corporations and protecting consumers. However, it did not address desegregation or education issues.\n\n(C) The New Deal: This initiative was implemented by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression in the 1930s. The New Deal introduced various economic programs and social reforms aimed at relief, recovery, and reform. Although it addressed social and economic issues, it did not specifically target desegregation of schools.\n\n(D) Reconstruction: This was a period following the Civil War, from 1865 to 1877, when the United States attempted to rebuild and reunify the nation in the wake of slavery's abolition. During Reconstruction, the federal government passed several laws, called the Reconstruction Acts, which aimed at securing civil rights, including the equal protection of the law, for African Americans. This includes the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868, which granted citizenship to all persons born in the U.S., including former slaves, and in 1870, the 15th Amendment, which granted the right to vote to all citizens regardless of race. These initiatives directly relate to the desegregation of schools and the concept of equal protection under the law.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n(D) Reconstruction",

Also the congressional reports of about 1840 are full of abuse of English, Scotch, Welsh immigrants as paupers, criminals, and so forth. Old citizens in Detroit of Irish and German descent have told me of the fierce tirades and propaganda directed against the great waves of Irish and Germans who came over from 1840 on for a few decades to escape civil, racial, and religious persecution in their native lands.

            "model_answer": "(B) The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step to justify our answer:\n\n(A) The Wagner Act of 1935: The Wagner Act established the National Labor Relations Board, which was designed to protect the rights of workers and unions. It has no direct correlation with nativism or xenophobia.\n\n(B) The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798: These acts were a series of laws passed by the Federalist-controlled Congress under President John Adams. They were aimed at silencing critics of the government, particularly those of French and Irish descent. These acts represent a clear example of nativism, as they were aimed at immigrants and their descendants, excluding them from certain rights and liberties.\n\n(C) The Espionage Act of 1917: The Espionage Act was passed during World War I and aimed to prevent interference with the United States' war efforts and to protect military information. While it did restrict freedom of speech, it was not specifically targeted at immigrants or focused on nativism.\n\n(D) The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965: The 1965 act was a major revision of the United States' immigration policies. It abolished the national origins quota system, which limited immigration based on an individual's nationality. As the act expanded immigration opportunities and was not focused on excluding any specific group, it is not an example of nativism.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 (B) exhibited nativism.

Therefore, this answer choice is not supported by the text.\n\n(D) Urging Congress to cut taxes and deregulate the economy: This answer choice seems unrelated to the context shared, as it does not address the challenges posed by Huey Long or the actions taken by President Roosevelt.\n\nGiven the context of the question and the information provided, none of the answer choices specifically address how President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to the challenges posed by Huey Long. However, since Roosevelt was known for his New Deal policies and wealth distribution, we can make an informed guess.\n\n(B) Launching the Second New Deal, a series of legislative acts including Social Security\n\nExplanation: The text does not explicitly mention the Second New Deal or Social Security, but both were key components of Roosevelt's wealth distribution effort during his presidency. Roosevelt introduced a series of legislative acts under the New Deal, which focused on redistributing wealth and providing economic security to the American people. Social Security, in particular, aimed to guarantee a minimum income for retiring citizens, ensuring they could maintain a basic standard of living. Although this answer choice may not be a direct quote or action by Roosevelt in response to Huey Long, it reflects the broader New Deal policies that sought to address wealth inequality and provide financial security to Americans.",
