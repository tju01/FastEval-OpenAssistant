This quote showcases Voltaire's perspective on life, adversity, and religion, which serves as the basis for understanding which of the characteristics of Enlightenment intellectuals best applies to his ideas.\n\nPart 2: Characteristics of Enlightenment intellectuals\nUsage: The four characteristics listed are accomplished scientists, new methods of communication, rejection of religion, and adoption of a more tolerant and objective approach towards social and cultural issues. Each of these characteristics represents different aspects of the Enlightenment movement and its intellectuals.\n\nPart 3: Identifying the best characteristic for Voltaire's ideas\nUsage: Voltaire's quote does not directly mention accomplishments in science, religion, or specific methods of communication. However, his critique of the suffering of common people and his questioning of religious institutions suggest that he may have adopted a more tolerant and objective approach towards social and cultural issues.

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\n\n(A) De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\n(B) Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\n(C) Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\n(D) De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.",
