            "model_answer": "To determine the best answer for this question, we need to understand the context and analyze each option.\n\nThe question is referring to an employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities. The context implies that the focus is on the balance between an individual's professional and personal life. Therefore, we can eliminate options that are not directly related to this context.\n\n(A) Presenteeism refers to the act of being present at work even though one might not be fully productive, for example, working through illness. This is not about balancing work and personal life.\n\n(B) Absenteeism refers to the practice of being absent from work, which also doesn't relate to balancing work and personal life.\n\nNow we are left with two options:\n\n(C) Work-play balance: This term typically refers to achieving a balance between one's work and leisure activities. It doesn't specifically mention personal life which may include relationships, health, and other aspects that define a well-rounded individual.\n\n(D) Work-life balance: This term includes achieving balance between an employee's work-related activities and other aspects of their personal life which defines a well-rounded individual.\n\nFrom these explanations, we can infer that the correct answer is likely (D) Work-life balance as it aligns most closely with the context of the question and with the desire for a balance between an employee's professional and personal life.",

An uneven distribution of resources can create barriers to a fair and effective partnership.\n- Co-opted: This term means being taken over or influenced by a more powerful party in order to use their resources for their own benefit, which is a potential risk when there is an imbalance of power in collaborations.\n\n(C) Informational asymmetries, Benefits, Hoodwinked\n- Informational asymmetries: When one party in a collaboration has more or better information than the other party, this creates an informational asymmetry.\n- Benefits: Considering unfair distribution of benefits, when one party has more information than the other, it is possible that one party gains more from the relationship while the other party gets less or no benefits.\n- Hoodwinked: This term can mean being deceived or cheated, which is a potential risk when there are informational asymmetries in collaborations.\n\n(D) Informational asymmetries, Resources, Co-opted\n- Informational asymmetries: As mentioned in option (C), when one party has more or better information than the other party, this creates an informational asymmetry.\n- Resources: In a business-CSO collaboration, resources can be financial, human, or material resources. When there are informational asymmetries, the party with more information may use their access to resources to benefit themselves while harming the other party.\n- Co-opted: This term means being taken over or influenced by a more powerful party in order to use their resources for their own benefit, which is a potential risk when there is an imbalance of power in collaborations.\n\nConsidering all the options and their reasoning, the final answer should be:\n\n(A) Power imbalance, Benefits, Hoodwinked",

            "model_answer": "Argumentative theory (A) hedonistic utilitarianism: This theory suggests that the goal of individuals and organizations is to maximize pleasure and minimize pain, which is closely related to corporate profit maximization. Utilitarianism aims at maximizing the overall utility or well-being, often measured by the consequences of actions, and corporations tend to maximize profit, which can be seen as a type of utility.\n\nArgumentative theory (B) preference utilitarianism is also related, as it argues that each person's preferences should be taken into account to maximize the overall well-being. However, this theory makes room for other considerations, whereas profit maximization only focuses on one aspect.\n\nArgumentative theory (C) The Categorical Imperative is about moral duties, and corporations do have duties to stakeholders, but it is not only about profit maximization. Furthermore, The Categorical Imperative is more focused on the duties towards others and less about utilities or outcomes.\n\nArgumentative theory (D) ethic of care emphasizes relationships and connections to other people, focusing on responsibility, loyalty, and kindness. It does not directly relate to the idea of profit maximization.\n\nSince corporate profit maximization is most similar to hedonistic utilitarianism, the answer is:\n\n(A) hedonistic utilitarianism",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer the question, we need to consider the main concepts and beliefs associated with Milton Friedman, who was a renowned American economist and the 1976 Nobel laureate in economics. Friedman was well-known for his beliefs on the role of business and the responsibility it holds towards different stakeholders. His views mainly revolve around the idea of maximizing shareholder value and minimizing the role of corporate social responsibility.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) The only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders: This aligns with Friedman's view that the primary purpose of a business is to generate profits for its owners (i.e., the shareholders). He believed that this profit motive would lead to a positive impact on society as businesses would focus on efficiently producing goods and services that people want.\n\n(B) Managers should act in ways that balance the interest of society and shareholders: This option reflects a broader view of corporate responsibility, which goes beyond Friedman's beliefs. While some managers and businesses may adopt this approach, it is not directly related to Friedman's views.\n\n(C) The primary responsibility organizations have is to its employees: Friedman was not known for emphasizing the responsibility businesses have towards employees, as his focus was more on shareholders and profits. However, this option reflects a broader perspective on corporate responsibility.\n\n(D) The primary responsibility organizations have is to its stakeholders: Friedman did not believe in directly considering stakeholders other than shareholders. Maximizing shareholder value is his sole corporate responsibility principle.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the given options, we can conclude the answer is:\n\n(A) The only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders",
