            "model_answer": "To address each statement and reasoning step-by-step:\n\nStatement 1: Linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.\nReasoning: The statement claims that the linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all impartial estimators. Variance represents the average squared distance of the estimated values from the true values. A lower variance implies better accuracy. Linear regression is an estimator that is often used in various statistical models. It finds the best-fit line through a scatter of data points, which is a method of reducing the dimensionality of the data. There are other estimators such as mean, median, mode, or other regression models like logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks, etc. However, among these, linear regression is known to have a smaller variance under certain assumptions, which means that it may offer better accuracy among impartial estimators.\n\nStatement 2: The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\nReasoning: AdaBoost, or Adaptive Boosting, is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for building classifiers. It works by iteratively adding classifiers that try to correct the mistakes made by the previous ones. The values assigned to the classifiers, known as the coefficients \u03b1, are generally non-negative values that help adjust the importance of a classifier in the ensemble. These values can be optimized during the training process to improve the performance of the classifier. Since the primary aim of AdaBoost is to improve the overall performance by combining different classifiers, it would not be possible to have negative values for the coefficients.\n\nNow, we will pick the answer based on our reasoning:\n\n(A) True, True - If the first statement (about linear regression estimator) is true and the second statement (about AdaBoost coefficients) is also true, then both statements are valid and the answer is (A).\n\n(B) False, False - If the first statement (about linear regression estimator) is false and the second statement (about AdaBoost coefficients) is also false, then both statements are invalid, and the answer is (B).\n\n(C) True, False - If the first statement (about linear regression estimator) is true and the second statement (about AdaBoost coefficients) is false, then the first statement is true but not the second one. This would mean that the answer is (C).\n\n(D) False, True - If the first statement (about linear regression estimator) is false and the second statement (about AdaBoost coefficients) is true, then the first statement is false but the second one is true. This would mean that the answer is (D).\n\nAfter evaluating each option and their outcomes:\n\nThe correct answer is (A) True, True, as both statements contain true information.",

Therefore, it's reasonable to assume this statement is true. \n\nStep 2: Analyze Statement 2\nResNeXts in 2018 usually used tanh activation functions.\n\nThe justification here is that ResNeXts, a type of neural network architecture for image recognition, used the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function in 2018.

            "model_answer": "To answer the question, let's break down each statement and discuss whether they are true or false.\n\nStatement 1: Support vector machines, like logistic regression models, give a probability distribution over the possible labels given an input example.\n- Support vector machines (SVMs) indeed provide a probability distribution over the possible labels. They assign a probability to each class and predict the most likely class. So, this statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: We would expect the support vectors to remain the same in general as we move from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels.\n- This statement is referring to the support vectors of an SVM. Support vectors are the data points that are closest to the hyperplane that separates the different classes. As we change the kernel function (from linear to higher order polynomial), the way the hyperplane is defined changes as well. Therefore, it would be reasonable to expect that the support vectors can change when changing the kernel function. Hence, this statement is false.\n\nNow, let's determine which choice best fits our answers:\n\n- (A) True, True: This option aligns with our assessments. Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false. Overall, choice (A) would be the correct answer.\n- (B) False, False: This option contradicts our assessments. Since Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false, choice (B) would not be the correct answer.\n- (C) True, False: This option also contradicts our assessments.

We can do this using the following notation:\n\nC(n, k) represents the number of combinations of selecting k items from a set of n items.\n\nLet's first consider the four attributes:\nWe have 3 possible values each for 4 attributes. We can calculate this as:\nC(3, 4) = 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 = 12\n\nC(3, 4) allows us to choose 4 items from a set of 3.

Let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Convolutional Networks:\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) are designed to process and extract meaningful features from images efficiently, making them suitable for image classification tasks, including high-resolution images. CNNs work well with high-dimensional data, such as images, by using convolutional layers to capture local patterns, pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions, and fully connected layers to classify the data. The inherent ability of CNNs to learn hierarchical feature representations helps them to capture both low-level and high-level features, which is beneficial for high-resolution image classification. Furthermore, advancements in CNN architectures, such as deeper networks and attention mechanisms, have led to improved performance.\n\n(B) Graph Networks:\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to analyze and process graph-structured data, not specifically images. Although GNNs have their applications in areas like social network analysis or molecule analysis, they are not the best choice for classifying high-resolution images.\n\n(C) Fully Connected Networks:\nFully connected networks (FCNs) lack the ability to extract meaningful features from high-resolution images because they do not efficiently utilize spatial information. FCNs treat all pixels in an image equally, which is not ideal for image classification tasks, especially when dealing with high-resolution images.\n\n(D) RBF Networks:\nRadial basis function (RBF) networks are mathematically simple yet powerful models for non-linear regression and classification. While they have some capability to handle non-linear relationships, RBF networks have not shown significant advancements or optimizations for high-resolution image classification compared to other architectures like CNNs.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the best architecture for classifying high-resolution images as of 2020 is:\n\n(A) Convolutional Networks",

The EM algorithm iteratively maximizes the likelihood of the observed data under the current model estimates and then adjusts the model estimates iteratively to maximize the likelihood.\n\nSince the EM algorithm repeatedly fits the data, it will generally improve the log-likelihood of the data.
