            "model_answer": "[Part #1: Three objects described in a fixed order.]\nUsage: The given input contains a paragraph describing three birds: a blue jay, a quail, and a falcon, arranged in a certain order. They are the three objects in this example. I believe it meets the criteria because each set of questions includes three objects arranged in a certain order.\n\nExample: Blue jay, quail, falcon. Objects are in the given input.\n\n[Part #2: Statements logically consistent within each paragraph.]\nUsage: The statements in the paragraph are consistent with each other: the blue jay is to the right of the quail, and the falcon is to the right of the blue jay. This means that if we arrange the birds from left to right, the blue jay will be on the right side of the quail and the falcon will be on the right side of the blue jay. I believe it meets the criteria because the given statements are internally logical and consistent with each other.\n\nExample: Blue jay (right of quail), falcon (right of blue jay), quail (left of blue jay).\n\n[Part #3: Choosing the correct answer from the given options.]\nUsage: We need to determine which object is the second from the left based on the given information. Since the blue jay is to the right of the quail and the falcon is to the right of the blue jay, the only object that could be the second from the left is the quail. I believe it meets the criteria because the reasoning is based on the given input statements, which are logically consistent.\n\nExample: Quail is the second from the left. Answer: (B)",
