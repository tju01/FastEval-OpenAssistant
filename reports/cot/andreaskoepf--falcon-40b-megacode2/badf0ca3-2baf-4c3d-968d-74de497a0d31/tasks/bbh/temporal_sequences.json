This means Emily was still at the train station at 12pm and thus could not have gone to the soccer field before 12pm.\n3. Ashley saw Emily fixing their computer at the electronic store from 12pm to 1pm. This means Emily was still at the electronic store at 1pm and thus could not have gone to the soccer field before 1pm.\n4. John saw Emily walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 1pm to 2pm. This means Emily was still walking around, not at the soccer field, at 2pm.\n\nGiven these facts, with the soccer field being closed after 8pm, the options we are left with are:\n\n(A) 12pm to 1pm - No, because Emily was at the train station and then the electronic store during this time.\n(B) 10am to 12pm - Yes, this is the earliest time Emily could have gone to the soccer field.\n(C) 2pm to 8pm - No, because Emily was walking around and not at the soccer field during this time.\n(D) 1pm to 2pm - No, because Emily was still at the electronic store during this time.\n\nSo, Emily could have gone to the soccer field between 10am and 12pm.

James woke up at 5am and was seen walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 5am to 6am by Sean. This period is not suitable for the beach, so we exclude it. \n2. No activities are mentioned for James from 6am to 7am, 7am to 3pm, and 3pm to 4pm. Therefore, these time frames are possible options for when he could have gone to the beach.\n\nHowever, there is a catch with the 3pm to 4pm time frame. It overlaps with the 4pm to 9pm time frame, which we have already established that James was not at the beach. Such overlaps suggest that there might be some errors in the data provided, but we will assume the data is correct and move on to eliminating any further options. \n\nGiven that the beach was closed after 9pm, it would be safe to assume that James could only go to the beach before 9pm. \n\nThus, we have:\n1. 7am to 3pm: This option does not include the 4pm to 9pm time frame, which we know James was not at the beach (due to the cafe visit). Hence, this option is suitable for James to have gone to the beach.\n2. 3pm to 4pm: As this time frame overlaps with 4pm to 9pm (which we know James was not at the beach), this option is not suitable for James to have gone to the beach.\n\nConsidering our above analysis, the best possible answer is:\n(A) 7am to 3pm",

Both Options (A) and Option (D) have overlapping times, which makes them less suitable.\n\nSo, between what times could Richard have gone to the physics classroom?\n\nAnswer: (B) 2pm to 4pm, (C) 11am to 2pm",

Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Tiffany woke up at 6am and was last seen at the library from 6am to 9am. This overlapping period of 3 hours should be safe to rule out as the time when she went to the market.\n2. From 9am to 12pm (3 hours), we know Tiffany was definitely not at the market, as she was seen at the library and also overlapping with other daily activities such as shopping and working out.\n3.

We cannot consider this time range for the market visit.\n4. From 10pm to 12pm (2 hours), the market was closed and therefore doesn't fit the conditions for Tiffany's visit.\n\nThat leaves us with the 6pm to 10pm (4 hours) time range and the lunch period from 10am to 12pm (2 hours). Since the market was closed after 10pm, Tiffany could only go between 10am to 10pm. However, we can further exclude the overlapping period from 6pm to 10pm and narrow down the time range further.

William woke up at 9am. - This doesn't help us in determining the time of the coffee shop visit, but it helps us build a timeline.\n\n2. Linda saw William playing tennis at the tennis court from 9am to 11am. - This constraint tells us that William was at the tennis court from 9am to 11am. We should subtract this timeframe from our analysis, as it overlaps with the possible times we have for the coffee shop visit.\n\n3. Emily saw William attending class at the school from 11am to 1pm. - This constraint gives us the same information as the previous one but overlapping a different time. Since we're subtracting the overlapping times, it reinforces our analysis.\n\n4. Nancy saw William walking in the garden from 6pm to 7pm. - This constraint doesn't help us in determining the time of the coffee shop visit, but it helps us build a timeline.\n\n5. The coffee shop was closed after 7pm. - This constraint gives us the upper limit for the possible coffee shop visit timeframe. Since we're finding the possible times, we must exclude the time past 7pm.\n\nNow, let's use the information we gathered to find the possible time range for William to have visited the coffee shop:\n\n- William was at the tennis court from 9am to 11am.\n- William was attending class from 11am to 1pm.\n\nTo find the common time range for these activities, we look for the intersection (i.e., the common element) between these two events. The overlapping timeframe would be:\n\n11am - 1pm\n\nHowever, this overlapping timeframe already includes the time when the coffee shop was closed, so we must exclude that part:\n\n- Since the coffee shop was closed after 7pm, we must exclude 7pm from our analysis.\n\nNow, we can see that the possible time range for William to have visited the coffee shop is between 11am and 6pm. However, this time range already includes the time when the coffee shop was closed, so we must exclude that part as well:\n\n- Since the coffee shop was closed after 7pm, we must exclude 6pm from our analysis.\n\nThis leaves us with the time range of 11am to 5pm, which doesn't have the overlapping times or the time past 7pm. Since we're finding the possible times, we must exclude the time past 7pm.\n\nNow, finding the options that correspond to this time range:\n(C) 11am to 1pm\n(D) 1pm to 6pm\n\nBoth options (C) and (D) contain the possible time range for William to have visited the coffee shop, which is the answer we came up with using the provided information. Since we're finding the possible times, we must provide the answer without any extra information. The answer is contained in the options:\n\n(A) 6pm to 7pm - No, this range includes the time past 7pm and is therefore excluded.\n(B) 9am to 11am - No, this range includes William's tennis court timeframe, which has been eliminated.\n(C) 11am to 1pm - This range includes the overlapping timeframe we came up with, but since we already eliminated that, we're left with the common time range of 11am to 5pm.\n(D) 1pm to 6pm - This range was already identified as the possible time range for William to have visited the coffee shop.\n\nSo, our step-by-step reasoning leads us to the conclusion that the correct answer is:\n\n(D) 1pm to 6pm",
