The convertible is newer than the motorcycle.\n\nDuring our analysis, we do not have any comparisons regarding the ages of these vehicles. However, we can infer information by knowing the relative ages. Understanding that one vehicle is newer than another, we can conclude that this means the one that is mentioned first (in this case, the motorcycle) must be considered older or newer depending on the situation.\n\nSince the motorcycle is placed before the limousine according to both statements, and it is described to be newer than the limousine, we can conclude that the motorcycle is newer (which means younger) than the limousine, while the limousine is older.\n\nNow, we can apply the same logic to determine the age of the convertible:\n\n1. The convertible is newer than the motorcycle.\n\nSimilar to our analysis in Step 1, the convertible being placed before the motorcycle according to both statements and being described to be newer than the motorcycle, we can conclude that the convertible is a newer vehicle than the motorcycle and is, therefore, younger.\n\nApplying the same logic to the final statement:\n\n2. The convertible is newer than the motorcycle.\n\nNow we know the complete relationship among the vehicles and can determine their ages:\n\n- The motorcycle is the oldest of the three (being newer than the limousine and the convertible).\n- The limousine is the second oldest (being older than the motorcycle).\n- The convertible is the newest (being newer than the motorcycle).\n\nThus, our answer is:\n\n(A) The motorcycle is the oldest",
