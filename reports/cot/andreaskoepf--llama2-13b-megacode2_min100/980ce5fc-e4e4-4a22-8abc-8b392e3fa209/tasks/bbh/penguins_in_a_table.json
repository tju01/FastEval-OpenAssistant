To do this, we have to multiply each giraffe's weight by their respective age. Then, we can add up those products to get a cumulated weight.\n\nFor Jody, the cumulated weight would be:\nweight * age = 620 * 5 = 3100 kg\n\nFor Gladys, the cumulated weight would be:\nweight * age = 590 * 10 = 5900 kg\n\nFor Marian, the cumulated weight would be:\nweight * age = 410 * 2 = 820 kg\n\nFor Donna, the cumulated weight would be:\nweight * age = 650 * 9 = 5850 kg\n\nNow we have the cumulated weight of all four giraffes:\nCumulated weight = Jody's cumulated weight + Gladys's cumulated weight + Marian's cumulated weight + Donna's cumulated weight\nCumulated weight = 3100 kg + 5900 kg + 820 kg + 5850 kg = 16770 kg\n\nNow, we know that there is an option related to the cumulative weight, but the question asks for the cumulative age. Therefore, we need to make an assumption. Let's assume that the age and the weight of giraffes is directly proportional, i.e., the age is directly proportional to the weight. In that case, the age is likely to be directly proportional to the square of the weight.\n\nThe cumulated age of the giraffes:\nage = (weight^2/5) * age_min + (weight/5) * age_max\n\nReplace \"(weight^2/5)\" with the weight we calculated previously:\nage = (620 * 620/5) * age_min + (620/5) * age_max\nage = 3784000/5 * age_min + 124 / 5\n\n Replace the weights with the next giraffe's cumulated weight:\nage = (Gladys's cumulated weight^2/5) * age_min + (Gladys's cumulated weight/5) * age_max\nage = (5900 * 5900/5) * age_min + (590/5) * age_max\nage = 3711000/5 * age_min + 118 / 5\n\nThe cumulated age would be:\nage = (Donna's cumulated weight^2/5) * age_min + (Donna's cumulated weight/5) * age_max\nage = (5850 * 5850/5) * age_min + (585/5) * age_max\nage = 3548750/5 * age_min + 117 / 5\n\nContinuing this process for all the giraffes will provide a cumulative age.

Weight (kg) - there is a number (11) for Louis' weight in kg\n\nNow, let's consider the second line, which also has the same structure:\n1. Name - there is a name \"Bernard\"\n2. Age - there is a number (5) for Bernard's age\n3. Height (cm) - there is a number (80) for Bernard's height in cm\n4.
