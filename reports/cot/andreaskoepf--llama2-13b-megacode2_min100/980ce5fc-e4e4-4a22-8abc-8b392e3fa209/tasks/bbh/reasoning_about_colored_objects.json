First, we need to arrange the items in increasing order according to the color spectrum: black, orange, silver, mauve, green, and purple (since mauve can be considered a purpler shade of pink and pink is just a shade lighter).\n2. Next, we figure out the index of the previous item to the pen, which is the silver pen, in the array. Since the pen is the last item in the array, its index is 4.\n3. Finally, we take the output of indexing the pen (4) minus 1, which gives us the index of the item furthest from the pen. In this case, it would be: 4 - 1 = 3.\n4. Now, we can look at the original array of items and find the object at the 3rd position, which is the black crayon.\n5. The color of the black crayon is not one of the options given. However, it is closest to the color black in the options provided.\n\nAnswer: (A) red",
