            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which method of detecting breast cancer involves exposure to radiation, we should first understand what each method entails and then check if radiation is involved in any of them. Here's an overview of each method:\n\n(A) Needle aspiration: This is a minimally invasive method where a small needle is used to remove a sample of cells from the breast for testing.\n\n(B) Mammography: This is an X-ray imaging test used to detect abnormalities or tumors in the breast.\n\n(C) Mastectomy: This is a surgical procedure to remove breast tissue, typically in the case of cancer.\n\n(D) Lumpectomy: This is a surgical procedure to remove a tumor and a small margin of healthy tissue from the breast, typically in the case of cancer.\n\nNow let's analyze if radiation is involved in any of these methods:\n\n(A) Needle aspiration - No radiation used.\n(B) Mammography - Yes, radiation (X-rays) is used.\n(C) Mastectomy - No radiation used.\n(D) Lumpectomy - No radiation used.\n\nAs we can see, only Mammography ( Method B) involves exposure to radiation. \n\nHence, the answer is (B) Mammography.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) Vary from person to person: This is true because what is sexually exciting for one person might not be for another. What excites someone sexually can be based on their personal preferences, past experiences, and cultural influences. For instance, some people might be aroused by touch on certain parts of their body, while others might not be.\n\n(B) Vary for women depending on the phases of the menstrual cycle: While it is true that changes in hormone levels throughout the menstrual cycle can affect sexual arousal and desire in women, not all women experience the same variations. Additionally, these changes can be influenced by factors such as stress, mood, and any existing health conditions. Thus, the variation can be quite individual.\n\n(C) Are mainly on the lower portion of the body: Generally, the regions of the body that are sexually exciting can include different areas depending on the person's preferences and anatomy. The lower portion of the body may hold significance for some people, but it is not a universal truth.\n\n(D) All of the above: This option acknowledges the individual variability of sexually exciting regions and the potential for changes in desire for women due to the menstrual cycle. In this case, option (D) would be the final answer.",

            "question": "Which of the following is/are true of gonorrhea?\n\n(A) can be treated with antibiotics\n(B) has a high risk of infection with a single exposure\n(C) is asymptomatic (without symptoms) in only a small percentage of those infected\n(D) infections are limited to genital areas",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's go through each option step by step.\n\nOption A:\nGonorrhea can indeed be treated with antibiotics. It is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae and can be treated with antibiotics like ceftriaxone and azithromycin. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the first line treatment for gonorrhea should be ceftriaxone 250mg IM plus azithromycin 1g orally.\n\nOption B:\nGonorrhea can have a high risk of infection with a single exposure; however, it depends on several factors, such as the type of contact and the specificity of the contact point (e.g., abrasions, tears, or open wounds). There is no definitive risk factor for infection, but contact with infected individuals or genital contact with affected individuals increase the chances of infection.\n\nOption C:\nNot all gonorrhea infections are asymptomatic; in fact, a significant proportion of those infected may not show any symptoms. This can lead to undiagnosed and untreated infections, potentially perpetuating the spread of the infection and increasing the likelihood of other complications.\n\nOption D:\nGonorrhea infections are not limited to genital areas; the bacterium can also infect the mouth, throat, eyes, and rectum. The most common site of infection is the cervix in women and the urethra in men, but the infection can spread to other parts of the body through sexual transmission or contact with infected body fluids.\n\nAnswer:\nAfter analyzing the options, we can identify the true statement(s) about gonorrhea.\n\nTrue Statements:\n(A) and (C) are correct.\n\nFalse Statements: (B) and (D) are incorrect.\n\nSo, step by step, the answers are: \nA: True\nB: False\nC: True\nD: False",

            "question": "You are a homosexual male: Last night, you were tempted by lusty, swarthy Jacques (the king of fraternity row) to join him at the local dairy bar for a tall cool glass of milk. You also briefly considered studying for this test, but Jacques won out. In Freudian terms, which of the following was dominant?\n\n(A) the id\n(B) the ego\n(C) the superego\n(D) the Oedipus complex",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step-by-step, considering the different parts of the psyche as per Freudian theory:\n\n1. ID: The id is the part of the psyche that is driven by basic desires and instincts. It seeks immediate satisfaction, and includes the sexual and aggressive drives. In this situation, you were tempted by the lusty, swarthy Jacques, indicating an impulsive and pleasure-seeking desire. This suggests that the id is dominant in this scenario.\n\n2. EGO: The ego is the part of the psyche that balances the desires of the id and the moral standards of the superego. It endeavors to mediate between the other two forces. In this scenario, you briefly considered studying for a test, demonstrating a rational and analytical thought process. However, the id won out, which shows that the ego was not strong enough to suppress your desires.\n\n3. SUPEREGO: The superego is the part of the psyche that represents societal norms and values. It imposes standards and ideals, and promotes guilt and shame when those standards are violated. In this situation, briefly considering studying for the test can be considered an action influenced by the superego, as it represents something socially acceptable. However, ultimately, you chose Jacques, indicating that the superego was not dominant in this scenario.\n\n4. OEDIPUS COMPLEX: This is a specific Freudian concept related to the psychosexual stage in which a child desires the opposite-sex parent and wishes to replace the same-sex parent in the quest for Love and attention. This concept deals specifically with male-female dynamics and is not directly applicable to the stated situation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the dominant force in this situation is:\n\n(A) the id",

            "question": "Sociobiologists believe that there are more males than females with paraphilias because:\n\n(A) paraphilias guarantee survival of the species\n(B) evolutionary selection has favored the development of males who respond to novel sexual stimuli\n(C) of left brain/right brain differences between the genders\n(D) male brains are better developed than are female brains",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) evolutionary selection has favored the development of males who respond to novel sexual stimuli.\n\nReasoning:\n\n(A) Paraphilias do not necessarily guarantee the survival of the species. In fact, paraphilias can be detrimental to an individual's well-being, physical comfort, and social life, making them less likely to succeed in finding a mate.\n\n(C) Left brain/right brain differences between the genders might affect cognitive functions, but they do not have a direct influence on the prevalence of paraphilias.\n\n(D) The development of male brains is not significantly different from that of female brains in a way that would explain the prevalence of paraphilias. There is no general consensus on sex differences in the brain that could account for the observed differences in paraphilias prevalence.\n\nTherefore the answer is (B) evolutionary selection has favored the development of males who respond to novel sexual stimuli. This can be explained as follows:\n\nEvolutionary selection has favored males who respond to new sexual stimuli due to the theory of sexual selection, which states that individuals with desirable traits, in this case, a willingness to engage in novel sexual behaviors, have higher chances of passing on their genes to the next generation. These males were more likely to mate with fertile females and, consequently, improve the chances of their genes being inherited by future generations. As a result, the occurrence of more males with paraphilias is a reflection of this evolutionary development.",

After analyzing the study, we can determine that women were more likely to have experienced **C) guilt** compared to men.\n\n- The study's primary aim was to examine the difference between men and women's emotional response following their first act of intercourse. It was conducted on 1,433 undergraduate students from a diverse range of ethnic background.\n- The study aimed to understand the role gender plays in shaping attitudes and emotional outcomes following sexual experiences.\n- Participants completed a self-report questionnaire focusing on their emotional response to their first intercourse experience.\n\nHere is the conclusion based on the study:\n\n- The findings suggest that among women, **guilt** (C) **was** the most common emotion experienced after the first act of intercourse, regardless of whether the intercourse was condom-protected or not.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to note that individual emotional responses to sexual experiences may vary.

Let's analyze these potential outcomes step-by-step:\n\n(A) An increased risk of low birth weight babies: Cocaine is a central nervous system stimulant that can cause vasoconstriction, leading to reduced blood flow to the fetus. This can result in the baby having a lower birth weight.\n\n(B) Poorer growth and lower intelligence: Severe cocaine exposure during pregnancy can affect the fetus's neurological development, potentially leading to poorer growth and lower intelligence in the child.\n\n(C) Smaller head circumference: Exposure to cocaine has been linked to smaller head circumference in infants, which can be an indicator of neurological development problems.\n\nNow that we have examined each outcome, we can see that all three are related to cocaine abuse during pregnancy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: (D) all of the above.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question\nThe question presents a situation in which Joe is trying to get close to Helen but she appears to be uninterested in returning his advances. In addition, it states that Joe's behavior is typical in his relationships with women. The goal is to determine which type of lover Joe is according to attachment theory. Available options are given as (A) secure, (B) avoidant, (C) anxious-ambivalent, and (D) passionate.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the situation\nWe know that Joe is desperate to get close to Helen and this behavior is consistent in his relationships with women. This implies that Joe may have an avoidant or anxious-ambivalent attachment style, as both of these types of attachment styles are characterized by being uncomfortable with closeness or intimacy.\n\nStep 3: Check the options\nOption A, the secure lover, seems unlikely according to the information given, as secure individuals generally feel comfortable with closeness and intimacy. Option D, the passionate lover, does not necessarily imply discomfort with closeness. But most importantly, we can eliminate the option B, the avoidant lover, because, according to the situation, Joe is exhibiting desperate behavior (which goes against the avoidant behavior).\n\nStep 4: Choose the most appropriate answer\nThis leaves us with option C, the anxious-ambivalent lover, as the most plausible answer since this attachment style is characterized by feeling both a strong need for closeness and an equally strong fear of intimacy, which aligns with the desperate behavior Joe is exhibiting.\n\nAnswer (C) an anxious-ambivalent lover.",

Chuck is a heterosexual man.\n\nNow let's think about how their sexual orientations may have influenced their childhood behavior in terms of play:\n\n(a) Gay men, in general, tend to be more comfortable with male-typical play, while being open to engaging in both male-typical and female-typical play. This is because their interests may not strictly be confined to traditional male-female differences.\n\n(b) Straight men, on the other hand, typically align more with male-typical play during childhood. This is because their preferences may be more strongly influenced by traditional gender roles, and their attraction to the opposite sex can lead to a stronger identification with typical male behavior.\n\nConsidering these factors, we can reason out the following:\n\n1. Since Bruce is homosexual, it's more likely that he engaged in both male-typical and female-typical play.\n\n2. As Chuck is heterosexual, it is harder to say exactly what type of play he engaged in, but it's more likely he participated in male-typical play since it aligns with traditional gender roles.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the most logical option is:\n\n(B) Bruce likely participated in more male-typical play than Chuck.",
