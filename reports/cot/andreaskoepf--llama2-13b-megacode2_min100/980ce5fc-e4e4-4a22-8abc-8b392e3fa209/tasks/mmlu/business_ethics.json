            "model_answer": "To solve this task, we need to analyze the given statement and find the correct phrase that matches all the blanks in the most reasonable way.\n\n statement: \"adverts must not: encourage _________, cause unnecessary ________ or _____, and must not cause _______ offence.\"\n\nOptions:\n(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial\n(B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious\n(C) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial\n(D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious\n\nLet's break down the information provided in the question:\n\n1. \"encourage _________\"\nSurely, adverts should not encourage unsafe practices, which is covered by 'Unsafe practices.'\n\n2. \"cause unnecessary ________ or ______\"\nThis blank needs two words to fill, and both must make sense in the context. Combined with 'encourage _________' and 'Must not cause _______ offence', the most suitable pair to fill this blank should be 'stress' (or 'distress') and 'serious harm or distress.'. Thus, the blanks fit the context.\n\n3. \"must not cause _______ offence\"\nOffence is generally caused by content that can upset or annoy a large number of people. The other words in the sentence suggest we are forming a description of a negative effect that adverts shouldn't have on the wider audience.\n\nApplying our analysis, Advertising regulations do not characteristically aim to trigger loving desires (\"wants\"), jealousy, or any form of trivial offence. Therefore, the adversely affected stake and the culpability are predominantly stressed or serious.\n\nLooking at the options one by one,\n(A) have \"Unsafe practices\" which matches with our understanding\n(B) have \"Distress\" and \"Serious\" \n(C) have \"Safe practices\" which does not align with the heading of promoting negativity \n(D) have \"Jealousy\" and \"Serious\", which is not a typical marketing concept\n\nSo the best fit for the blanks is (B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious. \n\nNow Finally, as per the rule, the answer should be in a single letter followed by parenthesis. As all options given have been crossed out and the best fitting option has been identified, the answer is 'B'.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, first we need to understand the question and the given options:\n\n- We are asked to find the term that describes the obligations of workers towards their employer.\n- We have four options to choose from: (A) Employee rights, (B) Employee rights, (C) Employer duties, and (D) Employee duties.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) Employee rights: Employee rights refer to the legal protections and entitlements that workers have against their employers, such as minimum wage, paid leave, and workplace safety. While these rights are important, they do not directly describe the obligations of workers towards their employer.\n\n(B) Employee rights (repeated option): As mentioned earlier, employee rights are about the legal protections and entitlements for workers, not their obligations towards their employer. Therefore, this option is incorrect as well.\n\n(C) Employer duties: Employer duties refer to the responsibilities that employers have towards their employees, such as providing a safe work environment, paying wages on time, and adhering to labor laws. The term does not directly address the obligations of workers towards their employer.\n\n(D) Employee duties: Employee duties are the obligations that a worker is required to fulfill to their employer as part of their job, as defined by their individual contract or employment laws. This option directly addresses the question.\n\nAnswer: The obligations of workers towards their employer are referred to as 'Employee duties'.\n\nSo the final line should be: D",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each option and determine which one represents the employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities.\n\n(A) Presenteeism: This term refers to the practice of working while sick or not fully recovered, which can have negative consequences on productivity and health. Therefore, this is not the desired ratio.\n\n(B) Absenteeism: This term refers to the practice of missing work without a valid reason. This implies a lack of involvement in work-related activities, so this is not the desired ratio either.\n\n(C) Work-play balance: This term focuses on the balance between work and leisure activities. However, it doesn't specify the ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities, making it an incomplete description.\n\n(D) Work-life balance: This term is the most relevant to the question, as it directly refers to the balance between work-related and non-work-related activities. It suggests that an employee should have control over how much time they dedicate to each aspect of their life.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) Work-life balance",

However, this term is not directly related to the limitations or risks associated with business-CSO collaborations.\n\nOption (B):\n- Power imbalance: This is similar to option (A); it highlights the uneven distribution of power between the parties.\n- Resources: This term suggests that one party may have more access to resources, which can impact the distribution of benefits and control in the collaboration.\n- Co-opted: This term means to be used or dominated by someone or something, typically for political or military advantage. In the context of business-CSO collaborations, this can result in one party gaining undue influence or control over the other.\n\nOption (C):\n- Informational asymmetries: This term refers to the unequal distribution of information between the parties in the collaboration. This can impact decision-making and trust, as one party may have more knowledge or understanding of the situation.\n- Benefits: This repeats \"Benefits\" from option (A), which is a positive aspect of the collaboration but doesn't address the risks or limitations.\n- Hoodwinked: Similar to option (A), this term is not directly related to the limitations or risks of business-CSO collaborations.\n\nOption (D):\n- Informational asymmetries: This term is similar to option (C); it highlights the unequal distribution of information between parties in the collaboration.\n- Resources: Similar to option (B), this term suggests that one party may have more access to resources.\n- Co-opted: Similar to option (B), this term highlights the risk of one party gaining undue influence or control over the other, which can be detrimental to the collaboration.\n\nBased on the analysis of each option, the best answer is (D) Informational asymmetries, Resources, Co-opted, as it clearly and accurately identifies all the limitations and risks associated with business-CSO collaborations.",

            "question": "Although corporate profit maximization is not directly prescribed by major normative theories to which normative theory is it most similar?\n\n(A) hedonistic utilitarianism\n(B) preference utilitarianism\n(C) The Categorical Imperative\n(D) ethics of care",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "In order to determine which normative theory is most similar to corporate profit maximization, we need to analyze the core principles of each theory, and then compare them with the concept of profit maximization. By understanding the basis of each theory, we can eliminate the options that do not align with profit maximization.\n\n(A) Hedonistic Utilitarianism:\nHedonistic Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that aims to maximize happiness or pleasure for all individuals. It is an individualistic approach to utility, which means it may lead to the pursuit of personal interests, even at the expense of others. However, it does not explicitly support the idea of corporate profit maximization. Therefore, this theory seems less likely to be similar to corporate profit maximization when compared to the other options.\n\n(B) Preference Utilitarianism:\nPreference Utilitarianism is an extension of Hedonistic Utilitarianism and is more concerned with individual preferences and what satisfies them. It tries to maximize the satisfaction of individual desires, particularly through second-order desires, which means long-term desires such as happiness and well-being. While individual satisfaction plays a role, as for-profit corporations usually aim to satisfy their consumers and employees, this theory does not directly endorse corporate profit maximization.\n\n(C) The Categorical Imperative:\nThe Categorical Imperative is the central moral principle of Immanuel Kant's deontological moral theory. There are two formulations of the Categorical Imperative: \n- Formulation 1: \"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.\"\n- Formulation 2: \"Act so as to treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of any other, always as an end and never merely as a means.\"\nThe Categorical Imperative emphasizes treating others with respect, maintaining moral standards, and following altruistic behavior. While this theory does not endorse corporate profit maximization, it is more concerned with the way an action is done and the principles guiding that action, rather than the outcome. \n\n(D) Ethics of Care:\nThe Ethics of Care is an approach to ethics that emphasizes the importance of care and commitment to the well-being of both individuals and communities. It maintains that moral actions should be guided by demanding, responsive care for others, as opposed to strict adherence to principles. The ethics of care closely aligns with the concept of corporate profit maximization as it also revolves around meeting the needs and demands of clients, society, and the community, while promoting long-term well-being.\n\nBased on the analysis of the principles within each theory, it is most evident that the theory most similar to corporate profit maximization is (D) The Ethics of Care. This is because both emphasize attending to the needs and desires of individuals, including those who are affected by a company's actions. As a result, the answer would be represented in the following manner:\n\n(D)",

It implies that organizations have a broader responsibility beyond just profit maximization.\n\nNow let's recall who Milton Friedman was. Milton Friedman was an American economist and a leading figure in the development of monetarism. He shared the 1976 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Friedman's view on the responsibility of business came into focus with his famous 1970 New York Times article \"The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits.\"\n\nIn the article, he argued that \"There is one and only one social responsibility of business -- to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits.\"\n\nBased on this information, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) The only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders",

Interactions describe the connections between CSOs and businesses, while Outcomes refer to the results or consequences that may emerge from these interactions.\n\nThis choice can be justified to be a better option when compared to the other options.

This term does not capture the entire meaning of the definition, as fluidity could also mean consistency in some cases. So, this option might not be the best fit for describing flexibility in working practices.\n\n(B) Fluid: This term refers to something that is easily changed or adapted to new situations. This term seems to capture the essence of the definition of working practices, as fluidity in temporal, spatial, and task-related aspects would lead to flexibility in working patterns. So, this option aligns well with the definition.\n\n(C) Flexible: This term refers to something that is easily adapted or modified to fit different situations or requirements. Similar to \"fluid,\" this option seems to match the definition of working practices, with fluidity in working patterns indicating flexibility in various areas. So, this option also aligns well with the definition.\n\n(D) Modern: This term refers to something that is characterized by up-to-datedness or following current styles and trends. Although modern working practices might emphasize flexibility, this term doesn't specifically capture the fluidity or adaptability mentioned in the definition.\n\nBased on the analysis, both options (B) Fluid and (C) Flexible align well with the given definition of working practices.\n\nHowever, as there can only be one right answer, let's choose the option which stands out more and includes both flexibility in spatial/temporal and task-related aspects, which is \"Fluid\".\n\nThe final answer is:\n(B) Fluid",
