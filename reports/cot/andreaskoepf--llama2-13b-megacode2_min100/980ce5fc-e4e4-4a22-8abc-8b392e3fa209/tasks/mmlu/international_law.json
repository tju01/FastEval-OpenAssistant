            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which State exercises jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels, let's examine the different options:\n\n(A) The coastal State: This is the state that has its coastline on the same body of water as the vessel in question. This state would have the most direct interest in crime occurring on board vessels in its waters.\n\n(B) The flag State: This is the state whose flag the vessel is displaying. Although this state may have an interest in activities occurring on its flagged vessels, this doesn't necessarily mean it will have jurisdiction over crimes on board vessels in other states' waters.\n\n(C) All States enjoy such jurisdiction: This option is not correct because international law doesn't grant jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels to all states. Jurisdiction is usually limited to the coastal state, flag state, or some exceptional cases (e.g., piracy).\n\n(D) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea: While the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea does have jurisdiction over some international maritime disputes, it doesn't directly exercise control over crimes committed on board vessels in the same way that a coastal or flag state can.\n\nBased on the information above, we can conclude that the correct answer is:\n\n(A) The coastal State",

            "model_answer": "The term justiciability refers to the ability of a question or dispute to be resolved by a judicial tribunal or the court. In simple words, the question or dispute is \"justiciable\" if it can be heard and decided by a court.\n\n(A) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders - This statement could be considered true if a right can be enforced before a court or judicial tribunal.\n\n(B) Justiciability refers to the just nature or cause of a particular right - This statement is not entirely accurate because justiciability is a procedural concept, not a moral or philosophical idea.\n\n(C) Justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular right conforms to principles of justice - This is a more accurate statement but still doesn't fully capture the essence of justiciability since it mostly concentrates on a particular right being enforced rather than the ability of a dispute to be resolved by the court.\n\n(D) Justiciability refers to the obligation of a State to enforce a particular Right - This statement doesn't convey the meaning of justiciability, as it is about a State's obligation rather than the ability of the court to resolve disputes.\n\nConsidering the explanations for each option, option (A) is the most accurate answer for the meaning of justiciability, as it highlights that a right can be enforced by the relevant rights holders through the court system.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Responsibility to Protect (R2P) is different from humanitarian intervention in the following ways:\n\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC (United Nations Security Council) input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.\n\nThis difference is significant because R2P is a commitment that has been endorsed by the United Nations, setting a higher standard for the international community's response to humanitarian crises. It requires a more involved approach from the UN, specifically involving the Security Council, which adds an element of legitimacy and accountability in addressing these crises. Furthermore, the ultimate goal of R2P is the prevention of a humanitarian disaster, rather than merely addressing one that has already occurred.\n\nIn contrast, humanitarian intervention refers to unilateral or multilateral actions taken by States or non-State actors to prevent or intervene in humanitarian crises without a clear legal mandate, such as in cases of genocide or mass killings. While R2P shares some similarities with humanitarian intervention (mainly in terms of the goal of stopping atrocities), it addresses the issues in a more systematic and coordinated manner, with the explicit involvement of the UN.\n\nSo, while both R2P and humanitarian intervention aim to address humanitarian crises, R2P is characterized by its mandatory UNSC involvement and the focus on prevention, making it a less arbitrary approach.",

However, it doesn't mention the Lotus case explicitly.\n\n(B) This option refers to the case of the Khosa v. PEI Hotel Ltd. in the 1989 Lotus case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ).

            "model_answer": "The answer is:\n\n(C) The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources\n\nTo determine the best description of the UK Constitution, let's analyze each statement:\n\n(A) The UK Constitution's only source of power is that of the sovereign: This statement is not accurate because the UK Constitution derives its power from multiple sources, including both parliamentary sovereignty and the sovereignty of the people. While the monarchy does hold some power, it is not the sole source of power.\n\n(B) The UK Constitution gives the judiciary the power to overturn acts of parliament: This statement is not correct. The UK Constitution does not vest the judiciary with the power to overturn acts of parliament. Instead, the power to overturn legislation lies with the higher courts in the form of judicial review. However, acts of parliament can only be overturned if they are found to be unconstitutional or in violation of human rights legislation.\n\n(C) The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources: This statement is correct. The UK Constitution is indeed uncodified, meaning it is not set out in a single document like a written constitution. Instead, it is a collection of principles and rules derived from a variety of sources, including statutes, common law, and conventions. Key sources of the UK Constitution include the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, the Human Rights Act 1998, and numerous parliamentary statutes.\n\n(D) The UK Constitution is based on a Bill of Rights: This statement is not accurate. While the UK Constitution does have several key documents and statutes, such as the Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights, it is not solely based on a single Bill of Rights. The Constitution is a complex and varied entity, consisting of various principles and rules derived from multiple sources.\n\nBased on our analysis, the best description of the UK Constitution is statement (C) since it accurately describes the uncodified nature of the UK Constitution and its sources.",

Furthermore, it states a \"strict obligation\" to resolve disputes as \"soon as possible\", which may not always be the case in complex disputes.\n\n(B) It is an obligation of conduct, i.e., States have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means. This does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes\n\nThis option shows an emphasis on \"peaceful means\" to resolve disputes, which directly refers to the peaceful settlement of disputes. However, it mentions that this obligation does not entail a requirement to actually solve the dispute, which could be a potential limitation.\n\n(C) It is a peremptory norm of international law and all States have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute\n\nThis option describes the peaceful settlement of disputes as a \"peremptory norm\" which means that it is a fundamental principle of international law that applies to all States. Thus, all States have an interest in abiding by and protecting this norm.\n\n(D) It is an obligation which concerns solely international courts and tribunals\n\nThis option claims that the peaceful settlement of disputes is concerned only with international courts and tribunals. This limitation somewhat misses the broader perspective of the peacemaking and reconciling function that this principle serves.\n\nConsidering the options, option (C) most accurately explains the obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes as a peremptory norm that all States have a legal interest to safeguard in any given dispute.

This is consistent with the concept of international legal personality.\n\n  (C) It means that an entity may challenge the authority of States: This option is not accurate, as international legal personality does not inherently give an entity the power to challenge the authority of states.

The two covenants contain the obligations and rights concerning civil, cultural, economic, and social rights. This makes the committee a treaty-based human rights mechanism.\n\n(B) The UN Human Rights Council: The UN Human Rights Council is a part of the United Nations responsible for strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights around the globe. Although it deals with human rights, it does not have a specific treaty that it monitors and enforces. Therefore, it's not a treaty-based human rights mechanism.\n\n(C) The UN Universal Periodic Review: The UN Universal Periodic Review is a process through which the human rights records of all UN Member States are assessed. It is a mechanism of the Human Rights Council, where all UN Member States are examined under the same protocol. It does not have a specific treaty that it monitors and enforces, so it's not a treaty-based human rights mechanism.\n\n(D) The UN special mandates: The UN special mandates are independent experts appointed by the Human Rights Council or the General Assembly to address specific human rights situations in different regions or thematic areas.
