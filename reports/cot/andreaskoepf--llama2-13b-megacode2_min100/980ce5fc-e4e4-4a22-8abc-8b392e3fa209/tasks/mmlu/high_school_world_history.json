            "model_answer": "The passage you provided is most associated with:\n\n(A) The formation of the non-aligned movement.\n\nHere is an explanation of the development, and how this passage relates to it step-by-step:\n\n1. The excerpt discusses the urgency of preserving peace and emphasizes the responsibility of Asian and African countries to work together for this goal.\n2. Indonesian leader Sukarno is mentioned as addressing the conference in Bandung, thus specifying the time and location of the event.\n3. The conference itself, which took place in 1955, aimed to bring together leaders from Asian and African countries.\n4. The passage states that the united voice of reason can be used to further peace on a global scale, highlighting the intentions of these leaders to play a positive role in international affairs.\n\nBased on these points, it can be concluded that the passage is related to the formation of the non-aligned movement. The main idea of the non-aligned movement was to ensure that newly independent Asian and African countries would not fall under the influence of either the United States or the Soviet Union during the Cold War era. By working together and promoting peace, these countries sought to maintain their independence and avoid being drawn into the larger power struggles between superpowers.",

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The passage discusses the different strategic decisions made by European and Chinese societies in response to their respective geopolitical challenges.\n\nEuropean states invested in developing early cannons and gunpowder weapons because they were highly valuable during protracted sieges, a common form of warfare in that time. Consequently, their governments found it worthwhile to research and improve these weapons.\n\nOn the other hand, China faced threats from powerful and mobile steppe nomads, who were difficult to combat using early gunpowder weapons because of their bulky nature. As a result, China focused on enhancing its horse archer units.\n\nTo determine which of the four large-scale questions best fits this passage, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) The passage mentions how societies shared strategically important technologies - specifically gunpowder weapons. This option highlights technology sharing but does not emphasize the strategic differences between European and Chinese societies or the impacts of their geopolitical challenges.\n\n(B) This question focuses on European states gaining military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era \u2013 which is not the focus of this passage. The passage mainly explores how both European and Chinese societies adapted to their respective geopolitical challenges during their medieval period (1200s-1400s).\n\n(C) The Silk Road commerce and the decline thereof are not mentioned in this passage, so this option is not relevant.\n\n(D) Although the passage briefly touches upon the fact that European states were more willing to invest in experimental and complex technologies, it does not discuss the medieval climate optimum's role in cultural diffusion. Therefore, this option doesn't relate to the passage's main line of argument.\n\nConsidering the passage's central theme, the large-scale question closely related to the argument is:\n\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n\nHowever, the answer should only be the letter 'B', not the entire explanation.",

When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him.

He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away.

A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it.

British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence.

The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin.
