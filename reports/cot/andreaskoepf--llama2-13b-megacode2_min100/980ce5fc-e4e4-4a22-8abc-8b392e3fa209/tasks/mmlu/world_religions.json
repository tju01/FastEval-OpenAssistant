            "question": " What can murtis be translated as?\n\n(A) Offerings\n(B) Prayers\n(C) Apparitions\n(D) Idols",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Offerings: In the context of Hinduism and religious practices, murtis can refer to the physical forms or idols of a god or goddess. These murtis are typically used as a focus for prayer or worship and are often placed in a temple or home. It is common for devotees to make offerings to these murtis, which could consist of flowers, fruit, or other items.\n\n(B) Prayers: While murtis can often be the focus of prayer in religious contexts, the term itself is not synonymous with prayers. Prayers are spoken or sung expressions of religious devotion and are spoken by individuals or groups, while murtis are more like the physical forms or idols of a deity.\n\n(C) Apparitions: An apparition generally refers to a supernatural or ghost-like manifestation of a spirit or other non-material being. Technically, a murtis is not an apparition since a murtis is a physical representation of a deity, even if it is worshipped or represents a divine presence.\n\n(D) Idols: As established in option A, a murtis can be translated as an idol. The term murtis refer to the physical forms or idols of a god or goddess in Hinduism.\n\nNow, based on our analysis:\n\nThe most accurate translation of murtis in the given context is:\n\n(A) Offerings (D) Idols \n\nThese are the most accurate translations since murtis are physical forms representing deities and serve as a focus for worship and prayer.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) Daoism - Daoism is a philosophical system that emphasizes \"the Way\" (Dao) of nature, and it advocates a balance with the natural environment. It focuses on harmony and reflecting the natural order of the universe. This option could be relevant.\n\n(B) Yin-Yang School - Yin-Yang is a concept in Chinese philosophy that talks about the balance between opposite forces in the universe and everything in life. The Yin-Yang principle emphasizes harmony and is closely related to understanding the natural world. This option could also be relevant.\n\n(C) Mengzi - Mengzi, also known as Mencius, was a Confucian philosopher who concentrated on virtues such as humaneness, rightness, wisdom, and courage. Although he talked about humans and their relationships with each other, he did not focus on natural elements and processes. This option is likely not relevant.\n\n(D) Humanistic Buddhism - Humanistic Buddhism is a modern interpretation of Buddhism. It emphasizes human potential and self-improvement, rather than relying on supernatural elements or deities. While it can be seen as promoting harmony, it doesn't specifically focus on natural elements and processes. This option is likely not relevant.\n\nAfter analyzing the given options, we can conclude that the naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes are associated with:\n\n(A) Daoism",

This festival was also known as the \"New Year Festival of Belshazzar.\" It was a significant event that marked the beginning of the New Year in Babylon around 2000 BCE.

Calling divine revelation \"Shabad\" makes sense as important spiritual teachings are often communicated through poetry or hymns in many religions.\n\n(B) Khalse: Khalse is not a widely-known term and does not seem to be associated with divine revelation. Plus, it doesn't represent Sikh principles or beliefs.\n\n(C) Nam: While Nam means \"name\" in Sanskrit, it is not a term used to denote divine revelation by Guru Nanak or in Sikhism.\n\n(D) Guru: Guru is a teacher or spiritual guide in Sikhism, not a term specifically related to divine revelation.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, we can conclude that Guru Nanak used the term:\n\nShabad",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "In order to answer this question, let us first analyze the given options:\n\n(A) Muhammad's miraculous ascent to heaven\n\n(B) Muhammad's migration to Mecca\n\n(C) Muhammad's first community in Mecca\n\n(D) Muhammad's revelations of the Qur'an\n\nFrom our knowledge, the Mi'raj refers to a significant event in the life of Prophet Muhammad. Let's consider each option:\n\n(A) Muhammad's miraculous ascent to heaven: This option seems plausible, as it involves an important event from Islamic tradition. The mi'raj refers to the night when Prophet Muhammad went to heaven and spoke with Allah. During this journey, he traveled from the Kaaba in Mecca to the heavenly throne in Jerusalem and then up to heaven, where he learned about Islam and its requirements.\n\n(B) Muhammad's migration to Mecca: This option does not match the description of the mi'raj. Muhammad migrated, or \"hijra,\" from Mecca to Medina due to the persecution and the promise of protection from the people of Medina. However, the Meccan migration happened before the mi'raj event.\n\n(C) Muhammad's first community in Mecca: This option is not relevant to the mi'raj event. The first Muslim community formed in the context of harmony and cooperation among the people of Mecca who followed Islam during the early years after the first revelation.\n\n(D) Muhammad's revelations of the Qur'an: This event does not fit the description of the mi'raj. The revelation of the Qur'an began with the first revelation received by Muhammad in Mecca around 610 CE. The mi'raj happened around 21 years later, during the time when Muhammad and his followers were in Medina.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning leads us to conclude that the correct option is:\n\n(A) Muhammad's miraculous ascent to heaven.\n\nThe mi'raj is Muhammad's miraculous ascent to heaven, as this event is a key part of the Islamic tradition and has distinct characteristics from the other options listed.",

            "model_answer": "We are given four options, and I must choose the one that is most likely the most famous dharmashastra and was likely written around the first century. Here's why each choice seems reasonable:\n\n(A) Laws of Dharma: Dharma in Hinduism is the concept of religious conduct, and there could be multiple texts discussing dharmic rules. However, this option does not specify which particular dharmashastra it refers to.\n\n(B) Laws of Karma: Karma is the concept of cause and effect in Hinduism; it's not specific to one famous dharmashastra.\n\n(C) Laws of Vishnu: Vishnu is one of the Hindu gods and although there are many texts about Vishnu and related stories, none of these texts focus specifically on laws or conduct.\n\n(D) Laws of Manu: This seems to be the most reasonable choice. Manu is a legendary lawgiver in Hinduism, and the \"Laws of Manu\" is a famous dharmashastra that deals with religious, legal, and social ideas. The \"Laws of Manu\" is widely regarded as one of the most important works of Hindu law.

            "model_answer": "The term \"Qur'an\" literally means (C) The Recitation.\n\nThe Qur'an is the holy book of Islam. It is believed to be the verbatim word of God, as spoken to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel. The word \"Qur'an\" is derived from the root word \"qur'a\", which means \"to recite\" or \"to read\". The reason it is translated as \"The Recitation\" is because the traditional way of preserving and conveying the divine message in Islam was through oral transmission. While it was always recorded in written form, it was first recitated by the Prophet Muhammad and understood to be the word of God through revelations received by him. Therefore, the name \"Qur'an\" reflects this essential aspect of the Islamic belief and practice.",
