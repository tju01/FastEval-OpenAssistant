This information is related to the ideals of manifest destiny and does not address the means of acquiring the Oregon Territory.\n\n(B) The quote talks about divine principles, the temple on earth, and the union of many republics; it doesn't mention buying land from the Native Americans.\n\n(C) The quote mentions a union of many republics, but it does not specifically mention U.S. settlers claiming the territory for their country.\n\n(D) The quote talks about the era of American greatness and future manifest destiny, but it does not mention a negotiated treaty with Great Britain.\n\nAmong these options, none of them correctly answer how the United States came into possession of the Oregon Territory. However, I will now address the correct answer to the question:\n\n(E) The United States took possession of the Oregon Territory through a diplomatic agreement known as the Oregon Treaty, signed in 1846 with Great Britain. In this treaty, the United States and Great Britain jointly claimed the Oregon Territory. Later, in 1848, the Oregon Territory was split, and the boundary between the United States and British territory was established at the 49th parallel, north of the San Juan Islands in Puget Sound. This resolution was also made possible in the Treaty of Washington in 1871, which established the northern boundary of thecontiguous United States as the 49th parallel south of the Strait of Georgia and Juan de Fuca Strait.",

When President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, it lifted the tide of the war in favor of the Union. By declaring that all slaves in Confederate territories \"shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free,\" Lincoln cut off a significant source of labor and manpower for the Confederacy and undermined one of the key foundations of the Southern economy. As a result, many slaves deserted their Confederate masters and joined Union forces.\n\nThe Proclamation also altered the international perception of the war. Prior to the Proclamation, many abolitionists in Europe were wary to support the United States due to the presence of slavery. However, the Proclamation strengthened the Union's cause by transforming the conflict into a war against slavery \u2013 a just cause that many Europeans supported.\n\nMoreover, the Proclamation demoralized the Confederacy. It eliminated the possibility of any possible peace agreement that would maintain slavery, as the South's economical and social structure was heavily reliant on slave labor. The Confederate leaders were propelled to fight with even greater determination, even though ultimately it was not enough to secure their victory. Thus, implementing the Emancipation Proclamation played a critical role in turning the tide in favor of the Union and contributed to the eventual defeat of the Confederate army.",
