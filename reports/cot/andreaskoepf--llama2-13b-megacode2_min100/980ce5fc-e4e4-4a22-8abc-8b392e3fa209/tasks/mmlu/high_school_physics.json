            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first break down the main factors:\n\n1. The standing waves are produced by a 100 Hz generator in a string of fixed length.\n2. The tension in the string is increased.\n3. We need to find whether the wavelength of the new standing waves will be greater or less than the original standing waves.\n\nFirst, we must understand the relationship between the tension, wave speed, and wavelength in the string. \n\nThe wave speed (v) in a string is given by:\nv = f\u221a( lattice  Tenuto  )\n\nHere, f refers to the frequency (Hz), 'l' refers to the length of the string, and 'T' represents the tension in the string.\n\nAs we increase the tension (T), the wave speed (v) also increases. Since the wave speed is inversely proportional to the wavelength, we arrive at the following relationship:\n\nv \u221d 1/wavelength\n\nNow, let's consider how the wavelength (\u03bb) of standing waves is affected when the tension is increased. The wavelength of the standing wave depends on the wave speed (v) and the linear mass density (\u03bc) of the string.\n\nmod.frequency = v/wavelength\n\nIf we increase the tension in the string, the wave speed will also increase. According to the formula f = v, the frequency (f) of the wave will also increase, given the generator runs at a fixed frequency of 100 Hz. \n\nNow, assume the new set of standing waves produce a higher frequency (f1). This means that the wave speed (v1) will also be higher due to the increased tension (T). The equation for wave speed remains the same:\n\nv1 = f1 * \u221a( lattice  Tenuto  )\n\nPlugging in the values, we have:\n\nv1 = f1 * \u221a( lattice  Tnew  )\n\nWe know that the frequency (f1) of the new set of standing waves is higher than the original frequency (100 Hz). This implies that the wave speed (v1) is also higher than the original wave speed (v).\n\nNow let's consider the linear mass density (\u03bc) of the string:\n\n\u03bc = Tnew / \u03bcnew\n\nwhere '\u03bcnew' is the new value of the linear mass density due to the increase in tension. We can assume that the increase in tension is greater than the increase in mass density of the string. Thus, we get:\n\nT1 > Tnew > T\n\nIn conclusion, when the tension in the string is increased, the new set of standing waves has a higher frequency and higher wave speed. Since the wavelength (\u03bb) is inversely proportional to the wave speed, we can conclude:\n\n(B) The wavelength of the new standing waves will be greater than the original standing waves.",

Consider the situation when the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position. \nIn this case, the spring force would be pulling the block toward its equilibrium position, and the gravitational force (Mg) would be pulling the combined mass of the original and small blocks downwards.\n\n2. Analyze the frictional forces acting between the blocks. \nWhen the spring force and gravitational force are pulling the combination of blocks away from the equilibrium position, their movement will be opposed by the static frictional force (Fs) between the blocks. This static frictional force will try to keep the blocks stationary.\n\n3. Compare the magnitude of the static frictional force (Fs) with the force of spring (kA) and gravitational force (Mg).\nThe static frictional force (Fs) will be the greatest force of the three, because it will prevent relative motion between the blocks. When the combined weight of the blocks (M+m) is being accelerated downwards by the gravitational force (Mg), this will increase the static frictional force (Fs) to a maximum value equal to the gravitational force (Mg).\n\n4. Intuitively, if the smaller block does not slide off the larger block, the maximum static frictional force (Fs) must be greater than the force of spring (kA) and gravity (Mg). \nMathematically, this can be expressed as the frictional force (Fs) must be greater than or equal to the weight of the smaller block (m) times the spring constant (k) times the amplitude (A) divided by the combined mass (M+m) of the blocks and the acceleration due to gravity (g):\nFs > kA/(M+m)g\n\n5.

The force of gravity acting on the box is mg.\n4. To find the frictional force, we need to consider the static friction force between the box and the surface:\n   - The frictional force is mg (since there is no friction acting on the box, the frictional force is just the gravitational force),\n   - The static friction force provided by the surface is \u03bcg when there's no motion involved.\n   - When motion begins, there is a conversion of static friction to kinetic friction, and the box begins to slide.\n\nNow let's analyze the motion:\n\n1. The box slides with a speed v0.\n2. The kinetic friction force is the frictional force: \u03bcg.\n\nWe can write the kinematic equations to find how far the box slides before coming to rest:\n\n1. The work done by the frictional force is the negative of the change in kinetic energy: -\u03bcg\u0394x. Here, \u0394x is the distance the box slides before coming to rest.\n   - The change in kinetic energy of a sliding box is equivalent to the initial kinetic energy of the box, that is, mv0^2/2.\n2. The net force acting on the box is \u03bcg, which is the frictional force evaluated when there is motion.\n3. Using Newton's second law of motion: F_net = ma, where F_net = \u03bcg is the net force, m is the mass of the box, and a is the acceleration due to gravity, which is g. \n4. When the net force is equal to the weight (mg) of the box: \u03bcg = mg.\n   - This equation has a solution: \u03bc = 1 (kinetic friction is equal to the maximum static friction force).\n\nHowever, we are given that the coefficient of kinetic friction is no more than 1, so we need to adjust the calculations accordingly:\n\n1. We know that \u03bc is less than 1. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation for kinetic friction: \u03bcg = mg (1 - \u03bc) = mg (1 - \u03bc) cos(\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle of repose (the angle of inclination that the box is inclined at for it to start sliding).\n2.

The force of kinetic friction is equal to the friction energy that needs to be converted into kinetic to cause motion.\n4.
