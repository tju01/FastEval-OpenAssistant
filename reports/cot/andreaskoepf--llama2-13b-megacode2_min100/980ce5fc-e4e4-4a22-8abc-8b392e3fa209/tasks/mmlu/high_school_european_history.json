            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, let's identify the main points of the passage:\n\n1. Huxley mentioned that most people have a conception of life as something working through matter.\n2. Huxley spoke about the \"physical basis of life\" in the context of the substance protoplasm.\n3. Huxley described the breakdown of the matter of life into ordinary matter components like carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds.\n4. Huxley discussed the continuous death and vital manifestation of life.\n\nNow let's analyze each of the answer options (A, B, C, and D) based on the information provided in the passage:\n\n(A) a force that works through matter\nThe passage states that the idea of life working through matter is common among people. However, Huxley clarifies that the \"physical basis of life\" refers to the substance of which he is speaking (protoplasm). The passage does not suggest that life itself is a force working through matter, but rather that protoplasm is the substance forming the basis of life, working with ordinary matter.\n\n(B) essentially a philosophical notion\nThe passage does not discuss life as merely a philosophical notion, but rather focuses on the physical basis of life, which can be observed and analyzed scientifically.\n\n(C) merely a property of a certain kind of matter\nHuxley argues that life's matter breaks down into ordinary matter components, such as carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds, which do not possess any properties besides those of ordinary matter. This suggests that life may be seen as a distinctive property of a specific kind of matter, i.e. protoplasm.\n\n(D) a supernatural phenomenon\nThere is no mention of supernatural phenomena in the passage. The focus is on the physical basis of life and its relation to protoplasm and ordinary matter.\n\nBased on our analysis, the passage supports option (C): life may be perceived as a property of a certain kind of matter (protoplasm). Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n(C) merely a property of a certain kind of matter",

His questioning of the laws of movement and his description of the effects of the Lisbon earthquake show that he was aware of the new scientific understanding of the world. Furthermore, his use of phrases like \"best of possible worlds\" demonstrates his belief in reason and logic as a means to understand and improve the world.\n\nIn his critique of the suffering created by the earthquake and the societal problems it exposed, Voltaire addresses the religious and political systems of his time, questioning their effectiveness in addressing human problems. He asks about the role of preachers and the Inquisition, suggesting that they should be held accountable for the suffering they cause. His statement on holy scoundrels causing suffering highlights a call for examining and questioning established social institutions and traditions.\n\nVoltaire's perspective on the earthquake serves as a commentary on the scientific discoveries of his time and how they were transforming society's understanding of the world. His critique of the social and political institutions of his time reflects a belief in the importance of questioning traditional hierarchies and systems.

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?\n\n(A) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.\n(B) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.\n(C) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.\n(D) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported King Louis's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, while he removed their power.",

Saint-Simon's emphasis on King Louis's insistence on the constant presence of courtiers at court, as well as his method of bestowing favors, illuminates the importance he placed on power and control. According to the memoir, those who wished to maintain or increase their favor with the king had to exhibit conspicuous consumption, evident by their expensive tastes in clothing, travel, and entertainment. By encouraging such behavior, King Louis ensured that these nobles would rely on his bounty for survival, thus diminishing their financial autonomy and increasing his influence over them.\n\nThis information suggests that Saint-Simon, as a member of the French nobility, shared a perspective similar to that of the king. By supporting King Louis's efforts to consolidate power and extend his control over the French nobility, Saint-Simon demonstrated allegiance to the monarchy and favor for the actions and policies outlined in the memoir. As a result, it is reasonable to infer that his account of the political and social spheres reflects this allegiance, leading to the conclusion that he supported the king's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges while simultaneously reducing their actual power.",

So, there is evidence that supports this option. \n\nNow let's move to Option B:\nThe text speaks about how many men were left to find a living after losing their employment due to the machines.

However, the petition itself does not explicitly mention the Luddite movement, so there isn't definitive evidence to support this option.\n\nFor Option C:\nThe text states that the machines can do more work in a given time than a group of ten men together. It talks about how the machines have replaced the jobs of many people, and factories have moved to where these machines are located. This clearly indicates a shift towards industrialization and the use of machines to do work instead of humans.\n\nLastly, consider Option D:\nThere's no mention of apprentices or child labor within the petition.
