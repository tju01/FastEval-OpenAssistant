            "model_answer": "The task here is to identify the conclusion of the argument mentioned. The argument is an excerpt from Sigmund Freud's work, \"The Origin and Development of Psychoanalysis.\"\n\nTo find the conclusion, we should go through the argument step-by-step:\n\n1. The statement \"It is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients.\" sets up the problem, it explains the difficulty in recognizing in others the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that physicians see in their patients.\n\n2. The statement \"The arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes.\" offers a reason for the difficulty mentioned in step one. It states that the consciousness's arrogance, a component of the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks or inhibits the recognition of the unconscious complexes.\n\n3. The statement \"Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\" makes a link to previous statements. It specifies the reason mentioned in step two as a causative factor that hinders the convincing of people about the unconscious and the teaching of their conscious knowledge contradicting their unconscious.\n\nGiven these steps, we can see that the conclusion of the argument is (C) \"Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\" This statement brings together all the happenings explained in the preceding statements and culminates in a consequence that makes sense.",

This interpretation is indicating that all large apartments are smaller than some houses, which does not capture the symmetric relationship between houses and apartments present in the given proposition.\n\n(C) Some large apartments are bigger than some houses. This interpretation implies that there exist large apartments that are bigger than some houses, but it does not demand the existence of infinitely many such large apartments as the given proposition does.\n\n(D) Some houses are bigger than some large apartments.
