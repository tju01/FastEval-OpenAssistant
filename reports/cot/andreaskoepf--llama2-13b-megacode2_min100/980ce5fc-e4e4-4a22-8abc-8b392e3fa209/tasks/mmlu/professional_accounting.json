            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To calculate the estimated yearly yield on your investment, we will first determine the cost of renting the car for a year, assuming a 365-day year, and then subtract the annual maintenance and any other additional costs. Finally, we will calculate the percentage of the cost of the car that the yield represents to answer the question.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the cost of renting the car for an entire year (not including additional costs)\nThere are 8,760 hours in a year, so assuming 2 hours of rental a day, the car would be rented for 8,760 hours. The rental rate is $245 per hour, so we multiply the hourly rate by the total rental hours to calculate the total yearly revenue from rentals.\nTotal yearly revenue from rentals = Revenue per hour \u00d7 Total rental hours per year\n= $245 \u00d7 8,760\n\u2248 $2,149,600\n\nStep 2: Consider additional costs\nThere is a daily maintenance cost of $50, so we need to add this to the yearly revenue calculation to account for maintenance costs. However, there might be other costs that we didn't take into account, so instead of subtracting the maintenance cost, we will assume the maintenance cost doesn't significantly impact the estimated yearly yield. In that case, we add a placeholder value to represent those costs. Let's make it 10%, which is similar to the estimated maintenance cost.\nTotal estimated yearly yield = Total yearly revenue + 10% of the cost of the car\n= $2,149,600 + (10% \u00d7 $98,000)\n\u2248 $2,149,600 + $9,800\n\u2248 $2,159,400\n\nStep 3: Calculate the percentage return on investment\nNow that we have calculated the estimated yearly yield, we need to calculate the percentage return on the investment. To do this, we will divide the yearly yield by the cost of the car and multiply the quotient by 100.\n% of cost of the car as yearly yield = (Estimated yearly yield / Cost of the car) \u00d7 100\n= ($2,159,400 / $98,000) \u00d7 100\n\u2248 21.93% \n\nNow, let's see which of the provided options is closest to this answer.\nThe options are:\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%\n\nThe closest option to 21.93% is:\n\n(D) 183%",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first break down the problem and understand the concepts involved.\n\n1. Dean Co. issued bonds at a discount, meaning that the bond price was less than its face value.\n\n2. Dean used the straight-line method to amortize the discount, which calculates the amortization by dividing the discount by the number of years to maturity and charges or credits this amount evenly each year.\n\n3. Dean Co. used the amortization method for bond interest, but incorrectly used the same rate for all years, rather than the increasing interest rate as per the effective interest method.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given question:\n\n\"On July 1 year 7, Dean Co. issued at a premium bonds with a due date of July 1 year 12.\"\nIn this case, the bond was issued at a premium, meaning the bond price was higher than its face value. Now, let's discuss the effects of using the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method for an amortizing premium bond:\n\nUsing the straight-line method to amortize premium bonds would result in a gradual reduction of the premium. However, the effective interest method would have a faster and greater deduction of the premium.\n\nThe difference between the two methods lies in the amortization schedule. However, because the premium is amortized too quickly using the straight-line method, the book value of the bond (i.e., bond carrying value) would become overstated according to standard accounting rules, and the premium would show higher amortization.\n\nLet's now consider the effect of the premium amortization book value on the retained earnings and net income:\n\n1. If the premium is amortized too quickly, the journal entries would debit the bond's carrying value to decrease the expense and increase the premium. As a consequence, retained earnings would be negatively impacted when recording the overstated bond carrying value.\n2. Additionally, if the amortization is overstated, the additional slowed amortization would result in higher net income for the same cash flow.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude the following:\n\nThe bond carrying value would be overstated due to the incorrect amortization method. The retained earnings would also be negatively impacted because of the premium overstated amortization. The net income, however, would be overstated as a result of the higher amortization expense.\n\nSo the answer to the question would be (A) Overstated and (B) Understated.\n\nHence the final answer should be flattened as:\n(A,B)",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Let's break down the problem step-by-step and calculate the price of the bond.\n\n1. The bond has a face value of $100, so when the bond matures in 3 years, the bondholder will receive $100.\n\n2. The bond pays 5% coupons, which means the bondholder will receive 5% of the face value as interest payments every year. Since the face value is $100, the interest payment for one year would be:\n\n$100 * 0.05 = $5\n\n3. The bond has a yield of 6%, which is the annual interest payment that the investor receives from the bond divided by its current market price.\n\n4. We can use the following formula to calculate the price of the bond:\n\nPrice = Face Value / (1 - (Yield / 100))\n\nIn this case, the face value is $100 and the yield is 6%, so we can plug them into the formula:\n\nPrice = $100 / (1 - (6 / 100))\n\n5. Calculate the numerator:\n\nPrice = $100 / (1 - 0.06)\n\n6. Calculate the denominator:\n\nPrice = $100 / (1 - 0.06) = $100 / (0.94)\n\n7. Split the fraction to separate the numerator and the denominator:\n\nPrice = $100 / 0.94\n\n8. Now we find the product of the numerator and the denominator:\n\nPrice = $100 * 0.94, which equals to $94 (to two decimal places).\n\nSo the price of the three-year bond, paying 5% coupons and with a yield of 6%, is approximately $94.

            "model_answer": "Statement (D) is incorrect regarding the old building. I will explain the reasoning for each statement below:\n\n1. It will be reclassified as an asset held for sale.\n\nWhen a company decides to sell a non-current asset (also known as property, plant, and equipment), it reclassifies the asset as \"Held for Sale.\" This is done according to the accounting standard IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. The purpose of this reclassification is to present the asset in the financial statements separately from assets that the company plans to keep in its operations. Reclassification ensures that the asset is not being depreciated and its related accumulated depreciation is eliminated.\n\n2. It will be classified as a current asset.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Non-current assets are assets that are expected to be realized in more than one year or one accounting period. These assets can include property, plant, and equipment. The old building should no longer be depreciated and should be reported as a non-current asset since it was reclassified as held for sale.\n\n3. It will no longer be depreciated.\n\nThis statement is correct. When an asset is reclassified as \"Held for Sale,\" the company no longer depreciates the asset. Depreciation is an accounting method used to allocate the cost of an asset to its expected useful life over time. Once an asset is classified as held for sale, its depreciation gets stopped, and the asset's value is carried at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. This means that, in the financial statements, the asset's value will not be reduced gradually, providing a more accurate representation of the asset's value.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided information, the old building is being actively marketed for sale and will be reclassified as an asset held for sale, and thus, its value will not be depreciated.

Distributions to the owners were proportionate.\n3. With these changes, Carson would still have owned 40% of the outstanding stock, so his income would be directly proportional to his ownership percentage.\n\nTo find out how much Carson would have reported in gross income in this scenario, we need to determine how much income he would have received as a shareholder of an S corporation, considering his 40% ownership.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total taxable income and then calculate Carson's share of that income.\n\nThe company reported $400,000 in taxable income. Since Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock, his share of the corporation's income would be:\n\nIncome Carson would receive as a shareholder = (Ownership percentage of Carson) x (Corporation's taxable income)\n= (40%) x ($400,000)\n= $160,000\n\nNow, we need to determine how much of this income would be distributed as a cash dividend to Carson as an S corporation shareholder to be reported on his individual tax return.\n\nIn an S corporation, the distribution of income to shareholders is considered a payment for their services to the company, which is subject to self-employment tax (Social Security and Medicare tax for individuals). This tax is typically around 15.3% of the income distributed.\n\nAs we know, the corporation distributed a total of $70,000 in cash dividends to its shareholders. Given that Carson would have received $160,000 in this S corporation scenario, his share of the distribution would be:\n\nDistribution Carson would receive = (Ownership percentage of Carson) x (Cash dividends distributed) x (1 - Tax rate on self-employment income)\n= (40%) x ($70,000) x (1 - 0.153)\n= $28,000\n\nNow that we have the distribution amount, we can compare it with the amount Carson already reported on his individual tax return:\n\n$28,000 (Reported income) = $28,000 (Actual distribution Carson would have received from the S corporation)\n\nAs we can see, the amount Carson reported matches the new amount he would have received in this scenario as an S corporation shareholder. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(A) $28,000",
