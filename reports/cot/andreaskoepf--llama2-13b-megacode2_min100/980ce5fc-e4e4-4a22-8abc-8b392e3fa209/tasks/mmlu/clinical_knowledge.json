            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "In order to determine the correct size of cannula to use for rapid blood transfusion, we need to consider two factors: the size of needle and the size of cannula. \n\n1. Size of needle: The needle should be a larger gauge than the cannula to ensure smooth insertion of the needle through tissues. It should be large enough to penetrate the skin and subcutaneous tissue but not so large that it causes unnecessary bleeding or trauma. Considering that a 18 gauge needle has a diameter of 1.024 millimeters, while a 24 gauge cannula has a diameter of 0.918 millimeters, a 18 gauge needle would be an appropriate choice. \n\n2. Size of cannula: A cannula is a flexible, hollow tube that is inserted over the needle. Once the needle is in place, it's removed, leaving the cannula in the vein. The size of the cannula depends on the size of the needle, typically being smaller by one gauge. In this case, since we chose a 18 gauge needle, the most appropriate size of cannula would be 20 gauge (0.918 millimeters in diameter).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n(B) 20 gauge.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the key attribute in successful marathon running, we need to evaluate each option's relevance to the task.\n\n(A) Strength is important for running, but it is not the primary factor that determines success in marathon running. Strong muscles can help resist fatigue, but they are not enough to complete a marathon without proper stamina and endurance.\n\n(B) Power, although helpful, is not the main factor in marathon running. While having powerful leg muscles can improve running speed and help maintain momentum, it is not the critical aspect of completing a marathon.\n\n(C) Stride length is an essential factor in running, but it is not the key attribute in marathon running. A longer stride may help cover more ground per stride but does not necessarily equate to success. Marathon success also depends on other factors like pacing, endurance, and mental stamina.\n\n(D) Stamina is a critical element for marathon runners as it allows them to maintain a consistent and steady pace throughout the race. Marathon running is a long-distance race that requires a runner to conserve energy and maintain their strength for the entire duration without getting exhausted. Stamina is the foundation of an endurance athlete's ability to complete a marathon.\n\nTherefore, the key attribute in successful marathon running is:\n\nD) Stamina.",

            "model_answer": "We will analyze each option step-by-step to find the commonest cause of dementia in the UK. \n\n(A) Alzheimer's Disease:\nAlzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia worldwide, accounting for around 60-70% of cases. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes memory loss, cognitive decline, and difficulty in performing daily activities.\n\n(B) Cerebrovascular (Stroke) Disease:\nCerebrovascular disease, or stroke, is caused by the blockage or bleeding in the brain's blood vessels, which can result in cell death and damage. While stroke can lead to cognitive difficulties, dementia itself is not a direct consequence of stroke.\n\n(C) Lewy Body Dementia:\nLewy body dementia, also known as dementia with Lewy bodies, is a progressive neurological disorder that affects thinking, movement, and behavior. It is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, accounting for around 15-20% of cases.\n\n(D) HIV Infection:\nHIV infection is a viral infection that attacks the immune system, specifically CD4+ T cells, which helps the body fight off infections. POCD (post-encephalopathy syndrome) was a common complication of AIDS in the early years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which could cause cognitive impairment. However, modern HIV treatment has significantly improved, and cognitive impairment due to HIV infection has become less common in recent decades.\n\nAfter analyzing the four options, we can conclude that the most common cause of dementia in the UK is:\n\n(A) Alzheimer's Disease.",

Anaphylaxis is a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur quickly after exposure to an allergen. The symptoms of anaphylaxis can include:\n\n1. Difficulty breathing, such as shortness of breath or wheezing.\n2. Swelling of the face or throat, which can make it hard to swallow or breathe.\n3. Hives or other skin reactions.\n4. Nausea, vomiting, or cramps.\n5. Rapid or weak pulse, a drop in blood pressure, or fainting.\n6. Dizziness or confusion.\n7. Itchiness.\n8. Smooth or blue-tinged skin from impaired circulation.\n\nAfter reviewing the list of potential symptoms, let's examine what each of the answer choices represents:\n\n(A) Stridor: This refers to a high-pitched, musical breathing sound, which is a symptom of difficulty breathing.\n\n(B) Bradycardia: This refers to slow heart rate, which is a physiological response and not a direct symptom of an allergic reaction.\n\n(C) Severe wheeze: This sounds like a symptom of difficulty breathing, which is definitely a symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\n(D) Rash: A skin reaction, which can be a symptom associated with an allergic reaction and therefore a symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\nBased on our analysis, the symptom NOT associated with anaphylaxis is:\n\n(B) Bradycardia.",

They are designed to collect the output and keep it contained within the pouch, providing comfort and easy disposal for the patient.\n\n(B) The patient has a colostomy.\nA colostomy is a surgical procedure that creates a new path to divert fecal matter from the colon to an external bag. In this situation, closed pouches are applied to collect the output and maintain the dignity and cleanliness of the patient.\n\n(C) In the immediate post-operative period.\nClosed pouches can be applied in the immediate post-operative period to ensure proper collection and monitoring of output.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer the question, we need to determine which of the given options best describes the outcome of an increasing number of sprints. Let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Anaerobic contribution progressively increases?\nThis option seems plausible, as an increase in sprints would lead to a higher demand for anaerobic energy production to meet the energy needs of the body during physical activity. High-intensity activities like sprinting rely heavily on the anaerobic energy systems. As the number of sprints increases, the muscles would need to generate more energy from anaerobic sources, leading to a progressively higher anaerobic contribution.\n\n(B) pH of the muscle falls below 6.0?\nThe pH value inside muscle cells is maintained at around 7.0 during physical activity. While increasing the number of sprints might lead to acidosis due to an increase in lactic acid production, it would not cause a drastic change in the pH value so as to fall below 6.0. Therefore, this option is less plausible.\n\n(C) Blood glucose concentration falls below 3 mmol/L?\nBlood glucose levels are maintained within a range of 3.3 to 5.5 mmol/L during rest and up to 10 mmol/L during moderate-intensity physical activities. While an increase in the number of sprints might cause a temporary increase in blood glucose levels, it would not lead to a drop below 3 mmol/L. Consequently, this option is not accurate.\n\n(D) Relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases?\nAerobic metabolism's primary role is to produce energy by breaking down carbohydrates and fat stored in the body. In a resting state, the majority of energy is derived from aerobic metabolism. However, during high-intensity exercises like sprinting, the body prefers anaerobic energy production since it has a faster energy yield. Thus, as the number of sprints increases, the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism should decrease.\n\nTaking these considerations, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) Anaerobic contribution progressively increases.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we will consider each option and analyze its validity in relation to the condition of diplopia.\n\n(A) Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered.\nThis statement is incorrect. While covering one eye can solve diplopia in some cases, it doesn't mean that it will never occur if one eye is covered. One-eye coverage can help in resolving diplopia caused by strabismus or corrected vision, but it is not enough to prevent all cases of diplopia. Diplopia can still occur due to other factors, such as problems in the eyeball, the eyelid, or the brain.\n\n(B) The outer image is always the false image.\nThis statement is also incorrect. In some cases, the outer image might indeed be the false image in peripheral vision, but this is not consistently true for all cases of diplopia. The false image may also be the inner image in peripheral vision, depending on the neural factors and the underlying cause of the diplopia.\n\n(C) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards.\nThis statement is also incorrect. A fourth nerve palsy can cause diplopia, but it is not directly linked to looking upwards. The fourth nerve controls the lateral rectus muscle, which moves the eye outward. If the nerve is impaired, the eye cannot move appropriately, possibly causing horizontal diplopia, not directly associated with looking upward.\n\n(D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint.\nThis statement is correct. A sixth nerve palsy does indeed cause a divergent squint, which is a form of diplopia. The sixth cranial nerve controls the lateral rectus muscle and helps move the eye outward. If there's damage to this nerve, the eye will struggle to move outward, causing diplopia known as a divergent squint.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is (C) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards.",

However, sodium bicarbonate does not just increase pH and buffering capacity; it also speeds up the efflux of hydrogen ions from muscles.\n\nThis brings us to option (B), which aligns with the other aspects of sodium bicarbonate's effects on performance by reducing the pH, increasing the buffering capacity, and speeding up the efflux of hydrogen ions from muscles. This is achieved by the sodium bicarbonate combination with the sodium ions, which helps to convert excess hydrogen ions into bicarbonate ions, creating a more alkaline environment around the muscle cells.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) reducing the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.",
