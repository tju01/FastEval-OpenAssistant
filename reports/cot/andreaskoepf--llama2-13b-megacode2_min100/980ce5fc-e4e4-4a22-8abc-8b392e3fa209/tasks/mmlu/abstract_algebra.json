Base field: Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18))\n\n- The field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) can be obtained from the field Q((1+sqrt(2))/2, (1-sqrt(3))/2, (1+sqrt(18))/2, (1-sqrt(18))/2) by setting the variables (sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) equal to zero: (2, 3, 2)(since sqrt(2)^2 = 4/2 = 2, sqrt(3)^3 = 27/3 = 9, sqrt(18)^3 = 216/18 = 12)\n\n2.

However, this computation would be quite challenging and done using computer code.

            "model_answer": "Let's begin by understanding the problem. We are given the permutation p in S_5, which is a set of all permutations on the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. What we want to find is the index of p in this set. Let's break down the problem step-by-step and understand how the index is counted.\n\n1. First, let's describe the structure of S_5. It is the set of all permutations of a set of 5 elements. Since there are 5! (5 factorial) elements in the set, the set can be identified by the number of elements in the set and conjugation with the identity element e. Let's notate each element in S_5 as ( Kennaugh (Fletcher,Wilson) 1897).\n\nNow, let\u2019s find the index of p in S_5.\n\n2. Start with the definition of p. Since it is written as (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3), it means p is a rearrangement of the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} in which the numbers are paired up. P can be written as (12)(23)(15)(24), where 12 = (1, 2), 23 = (2, 3), 15 = (1, 5), and 24 = (2, 4).\n\n3. Now let's understand how the index is counted in S_5. The index of an element in S_5 is determined by its inclusion in the corners of the permutation. Since there are 5! = 120 corners, an inclusion is counted as 5! = 120 elements.\n\n4. Start counting the corners of p.\n\n   (1, 2, 5, 4) has 4 corners, and (2, 3) has 3 corners. The index of an element in S_5 is the number of occurrences in the corners of permutations it is a part of. For example, 2 is a part of 3 corners, 3 being (1, 2), (2, 3), and (2, 4, 5). For element (1, 2), 1 is a part of 2 corners, and 2 is a part of 2 corners. That makes 1*2 = 2 + 2 = 4 elements represented by (1, 2).\n\n5. With the understanding of how the index is counted in S_5, we can now find the index of p.\n\n   For (2, 3), 2 is part of 2 corners, and 3 is part of 3 corners. So, 2 is a part of 2 + 3 = 5 corners total. This means p has 4 (from (1, 2)) + 5 (from (2, 3)) = 9 elements in S_5.\n\n6. To get the index of p in S_5, we divide the number of elements (9) p has by the total elements in S_5 (120) to find the ratio of p in S_5.\n\n   Index = (number of elements p has) / (total elements in S_5)\n          9 / 120 = 3 / 20\n\n7. We can simplify the expression 3/20 to get the final answer.\n\n   Answer = 3/20 = 3 * (1/20)\n\n   The index of p in S_5 is 3 - 1 = 2 elements. However, 2 out of 120 is not unique, as there are 60 elements at a distance of 2 from the identity element. So, p has a total of 3 - 1 = 2 + 60 = 62 elements from two permutations (1, 2 Color, 5 being Black) which is still not a unique index.\n\n8. The correct answer should be (C) 24. We have used the same definition of the index to count the elements of p in S_5 as a reference point but found an incorrect expression from our calculation. The correct expression should be 3*20 = 60, and 62 - 60 = 2, which again is not unique. To ensure uniqueness, we must add 120 to both sides of the equation. 60 + 120 = 180; 62 + 120 = 182. So, p has 182 elements from S_5, and it has index 182 / 120 = 151 / 60.\n\nHowever, according to the guidelines, the answer should be a single letter without anything else, so we must discard this explanation and provide the single letter answer:\n\nAnswer = C",

If K is a non-Abelian group (i.e., it has more than 2 different elements and the order of every element is distinct), then the factor group (G / K) will also be non-Abelian, since the factor group contains all of the elements with their respective orderings. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2: \"If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\"\n\nExplanation: To verify this statement, take two normal subgroups K and H where K is also a normal subgroup of H, and H is a normal subgroup of G. These subgroups should be considered inside the context of the larger group G. Since G is considered the parent group here, any nested subgroup of G should be the entire group itself. That means if K is a normal subgroup of H such that H is a normal subgroup of G, then K should be a normal subgroup of the entire group G.

An element of order 15 means that the element has 15 distinct periods in its cyclic group. The nth element in a cyclic group will be the one that occurs after n - 1 periods. Since there are at least 15 elements in this group, it is clear that the group will have 15 distinct cycles, each with one element.

In other words, the group must have repeated at least once. Thus, the group must have at least one element that is repeated twice, which means it has at least 2 elements of order 2 * 15 = 30, etc., until you reach the smallest common multiple of 15 and the number of repeated elements, which is 16 * 15 = 240.
