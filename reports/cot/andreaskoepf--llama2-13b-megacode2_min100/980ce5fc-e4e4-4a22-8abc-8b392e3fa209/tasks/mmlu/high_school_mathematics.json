He can either choose an orange or switch to banana.\nProbability at lunch = 2/3 = (2/3) * (1/2) = 1/3.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the probability of choosing a different fruit at dinner.\nJoe has now eaten an apple at breakfast and an orange or an banana at lunch, so there are only 2 fruit types available (banana, apple).\nProbability at dinner = 1/2.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the probability of eating at least two different fruits at breakfast and lunch.\nThis probability is given by the probability that Joe doesn't choose the same fruit at all times\u2014that is, for each permutation where he doesn't choose the same fruit, he chooses a different one. This gives us a total of 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 favorable outcomes.

We are given that $f(x)$ has the strictly convex property, which implies that for any two distinct points $x_1$ and $x_2$ in the domain of $f$, the distance between $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$ along the curve $y=f(x)$ must be less than or equal to the distance between $x_1$ and $x_2$. This distance is given by the line segment connecting $(x_1, f(x_1))$ and $(x_2, f(x_2))$.\n\n2. Now, let's focus on the given values of $f(x)$: $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$. We can set up an inequality based on the strictly convex property for the portion of the graph of $y=f(x)$ between these points. The graph of $f(x)$ must lie below the line segment joining $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$.\n\n3. We know that the minimum value of $f(x)$ between $x=-2$ and $x=2$ is $f(-2) = 5$.

We know that John originally had an equal amount of hat pins in two piles, so we can represent the number of pins in total with the variable 'x'.\n2. John gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. To find this, we need to multiply the total number of pins (x) by one-half (0.5) and then multiply the result by one-third (1/3). In mathematical terms, it would look like this: (0.5 * x) * (1/3).\n3. According to the problem, after giving his brother this amount of pins, John had 66 pins left. Therefore, we can write the equation: 0.5 * x * (1/3) = 66.\n4. Now, we need to find the original number of pins (x) that satisfies this equation. To do so, we can first simplify the right side of the equation by multiplying the two fractions in the parenthesis: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.\n5. Now we can rewrite our equation as: (0.5 * x) = 66 * (1/6).\n6. Next, we need to streamline the right side of the equation further by multiplying both sides by 6: 0.5 * x = (66 * 1/6) * 6.\n7.
