Each segment can hold a program or data, and each segment has its own segment table that stores the segment's base address and other properties. As segments are of equal size, the system divides memory into uniform units.\n\nII. It permits implementation of virtual memory.\nVirtual memory is a memory management technique that provides an illusion of a large, contiguous address space by temporarily transferring data from the main memory to the disk. Segmented memory systems can only allocate memory to programs one segment at a time, and the operating system must manage paging along with segmentation. This creates a more complex implementation of virtual memory compared to a purely paged memory system. Therefore, purely segmented memory systems do not directly permit the implementation of virtual memory.\n\nIII. It suffers from internal fragmentation.\nInternal fragmentation occurs when a memory segment cannot be completely allocated to a program, because its size is not a multiple of the segment size. This happens when a program needs memory that is smaller than the memory unit size.
