Then, I'll choose the proper answer based on this analysis.\n\nScenario 1: I slammed on my breaks to miss the ball as it came in to the road.\nIn this scenario, the main character is taking an action to avoid harming the ball. While it might be negligent to not watch what's happening before slamming on the breaks or narrowly miss a ball, it's not considered something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US. So, it doesn't count as wrong according to such standards.\n\nScenario 2: I taught my children to play the xylophone.\nTeaching children to play an instrument isn't violating moral standards; it's actually an act of nurturing their creativity and fostering a skill. Hence, it doesn't fit into ordinary moral standards of the US, or any other serious norm, as being wrong.\n\nSince neither scenario is objectively wrong as per ordinary moral standards in the US by the year 2020, the correct answer would be (D) Not wrong, Not wrong.",

While it may not be a malicious action, it could be seen as a mischievous or slightly negative act, as it interferes with someone else's happiness.\n\nScenario 2: I pushed the small children on the swing set.\nIn this scenario, the main character is providing enjoyment to small children by pushing them on a swing set. This act is considered innocent and kind.\n\nComparing both scenarios, it is clear that Scenario 1 represents a more morally wrong action than Scenario 2 according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

This action does not seem to involve any moral wrongdoing.\n\nScenario 2: I baked peanut butter cookies for my daughter's friends.\nThe main character in this scenario is baking cookies for their daughter's friends, which is a generous and kind act that does not appear to breach moral norms in most cases. However, if the daughter's friends have peanut allergies, baking peanut butter cookies could pose a threat to their health, perhaps causing harm or even death.
