We\ufffdll consider the two plates to be of opposite charges; therefore, virtual medians connecting the corresponding points on each plate produce a directly connected electric line i.e., field line.\n\nStep 3: When dealing with infinite parallel plates, the area of individual medians is constant. Hence, the virtual median at the midpoint between the plates experiences the same intensity of the electric field as that due to one of the plates. This is because both plates have equal surface charge densities, and the electric field is inversely proportional to the distance between the plates.\n\nStep 4: Now, since the virtual median at the midpoint of the gap is receiving the same electric field due to both plates and because electric fields are superposable in nature, we can simply add the fields created by both plates.\n\nStep 5: Combining the fields of both plates will effectively double the field due to one plate, as the distance between the plates remains constant. We can calculate the electric field produced by each plate and then add them together as they act in the same direction. This leads to the final formula for the electric field between the plates:\n\nE_total = 2 * E_one plate\n\nConclusion: The electric field in the gap between the plates is double the field produced by one plate.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what a dynamometer wattmeter is and what the role of its moving coil resistance is in the device's operation.\n\nA dynamometer wattmeter is an electromechanical device used for measuring electrical power in watts. It consists of a moving coil, a shunt resistor, and a direct current (DC) motor. The moving coil measures the alternating current (AC) voltage, and the shunt resistor measures the AC current. The DC motor converts the power measured into mechanical work, which in turn, is indicated as the reading on the scale of the wattmeter.\n\nThe resistance of the moving coil is a crucial factor that affects the accuracy, frequency response, and calibration of the dynamometer wattmeter. If the resistance is too low or high, it can result in inaccuracies and incorrect readings of the electrical power.\n\nHaving understood the background, we can now determine the ideal resistance of the moving coil in a dynamometer wattmeter:\n\n(A) Low resistance \u2013 A low resistance would mean increased power loss in the moving coil, leading to inaccuracies and potential issues caused by heat generated in the coil.\n\n(B) Very low resistance \u2013 A very low resistance would exacerbate the problems mentioned above, leading to more significant inaccuracies and additional stress on the wattmeter's components.\n\n(C) High resistance \u2013 A high resistance would improve the accuracy and reduce the power loss in the moving coil. However, it would also result in increased measurement time and answers being slow to stabilize. This is not suitable for dynamic measurements.\n\n(D) Almost zero resistance \u2013 Having almost zero resistance would again lead to inaccuracies and power losses.\n\nFrom the above reasoning, it is evident that neither very high nor very low resistance is suitable for the moving coil of a dynamometer wattmeter. The ideal resistance would fall into a range where the power loss is minimized, and the accuracy of the device is maintained. However, the question asks to choose the best option among the given choices.\n\nIn this situation, the closest answer to the ideal resistance would be:\n(C) High. This is because it reduces power loss and maintains measurement accuracy, even though it is not an ideal resistance for moving coils in dynamometer wattmeters.",
