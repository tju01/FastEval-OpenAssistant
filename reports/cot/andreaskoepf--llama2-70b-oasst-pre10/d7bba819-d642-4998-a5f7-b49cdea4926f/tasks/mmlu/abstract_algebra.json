It is a way to study the structure of groups using factors.\n\nStep 2: Apply the hypothesis.\nWe are given that the original group is non-Abelian. To evaluate the factor group, we need to identify a normal subgroup and consider the factor group obtained by dividing the original group by this normal subgroup.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the factor group.\nLet's arbitrary choose a normal subgroup N of the non-Abelian group G. The factor group G/N is formed by taking the set of all the cosets of N within G. The claimed statement says that G/N should be non-Abelian.\n\nHowever, the structure of the factor group G/N depends on the normal subgroup N chosen.

Since K is a normal subgroup of H, it follows that it must be closed under conjugation in H.\n\nStep 4: Determine if K is a normal subgroup of G.\nWe need to check if K is stable under conjugation in G. Since K is a normal subgroup of H, and we know that H is a normal subgroup of G, we can consider the normality of H with respect to G.\n\nIn other words, we show that the conjugate subgroup gHg^-1 (for any element g in G) remains within H. Because gHg^-1 is a conjugate of H, it remains within G for any g.

Lagrange's theorem states that if a group G has |G| elements and an element a with order n (the smallest positive integer for which a^n = identity implies a has order n), then n must divide |G|.\n2.

Let x = sqrt(2) + sqrt(3).\n\nStep 2: Test possible rational values for x.\nSince x is either rational if it is an integer such as 0, 1, 2, or -1; or if it is the reciprocal of such an integer. We will test each of these values. If any tests negative, we can move to the next test.\n\nTesting with x = 0: Sqrt(2) + Sqrt(3) - 0 = 0\nTesting with x = 1: Sqrt(2) + Sqrt(3) - 1 = 2 * sqrt(2 + 3) - 2 * sqrt(2 * 3) = 2 * sqrt(14) - 4 * sqrt(6) = 12\nTesting with x = 2: Sqrt(2) + Sqrt(3) - 2 = 9 * sqrt(3) - 4 * sqrt(6) = 7 * sqrt(3) - 12 = 0\n\nTherefore, the minimum polynomial for (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) is x, which is degree 1. This means (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) is an algebraic integer.

So x is a product of two algebraic integers, one from sqrt(2) and the other from sqrt(3) in the form a sqrt(2)^m * sqrt(3)^n, which can be rounded to the nearest rational.\n\nBut since x is transcendental over Q, it means that there must exist a polynomial P(X, Y) where P((sqrt(2), sqrt(3))) = 0, and the degree of which is minimum. Therefore, the degree of the minimal polynomial of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q is 4.\n\nStep 4: Deduce the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) / Q.\nSince Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) is just a subfield of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), its degree is less than or equal to the degree of the field extension of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3))/Q, which is known to be 4.\n\nStep 5: Conclude.\nSince the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2)) over Q is 2 and the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(3)) over Q is 2, their combined degree is the same.
