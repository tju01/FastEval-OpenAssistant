            "model_answer": "To determine the appropriate size of cannula for a rapid blood transfusion, we need to consider the required flow rate and the potential for complications.\n\nStep 1: Consider the required flow rate\nA rapid blood transfusion typically requires a high flow rate to quickly replenish the patient's blood volume. Larger gauge cannulae (lower number) have a larger internal diameter, thus allowing for a higher flow rate than smaller gauge cannulae.\n\nStep 2: Assess potential complications\nUsing a larger gauge cannula may allow for a faster transfusion, but it also has an increased risk of complications such as blood clotting, vessel damage, and bleeding. Thus, a balance between the flow rate and potential complications is necessary.\n\nStep 3: Weigh the advantages and disadvantages\nAs we need a rapid blood transfusion, a larger gauge cannula may be suitable, as long as the risks are managed.\n\nConsidering the options provided:\n(A) 18 gauge.\n(B) 20 gauge.\n(C) 22 gauge.\n(D) 24 gauge.\n\nWe can deduce that the 18-gauge cannula (A) offers the best balance between flow rate and potential complications. It has a relatively large internal diameter for a high flow rate but also poses a manageable risk for complications in most situations.\n\nAnswer: (A) 18 gauge.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the key attribute in successful marathon running, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Strength: While strength is important in any physical activity, marathon running specifically requires sustained endurance rather than brute strength. Thus, although it plays a role, strength may not be the most crucial factor.\n\n(B) Power: Power refers to an athlete's ability to generate force quickly. However, marathon running is defined by its long distances and requires a runner to maintain a consistent pace for an extended period. Therefore, power is not the most critical factor in successful marathon running.\n\n(C) Stride length: Stride length can contribute to a runner's efficiency, but it is also influenced by many factors such as running economy, technique, and cadence. Although stride length is relevant, it is not the sole determinant of success in marathon running.\n\n(D) Stamina: Stamina refers to an athlete's ability to maintain their performance level over an extended period. In marathon running, success is determined by a runner's capacity to maintain a consistent pace for 26.2 miles (42.2 km). This requires incredible endurance and the ability to keep going despite fatigue, making stamina the most crucial factor.\n\nTherefore, the key attribute in successful marathon running is:\n(D) stamina.",

It is the most common form of dementia, not only in the UK but also worldwide.\n\n(B) Cerebrovascular (stroke) disease: A type of dementia caused by damaged blood vessels in the brain, leading to loss of brain tissue. This type of dementia is associated with a history of strokes or blockages in the brain blood vessels.\n\n(C) Lewy body dementia: A progressive disorder characterized by the build-up of abnormal proteins called Lewy bodies in the brain. This type of dementia is more often associated with a combination of cognitive difficulties and movement problems similar to Parkinson's disease.\n\n(D) HIV infection: A viral infection that attacks and weakens the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infections and diseases. HIV infection is not a direct cause of dementia but may lead to opportunistic infections or complications that can impact cognitive function.\n\nStep 3: Identify the most common cause of dementia in the UK based on the given options.\n\nBased on the evaluation of each option, it is clear that Alzheimer's disease (option A) is the most common form of dementia in the UK.

In this case, closed pouches can help with managing and containing any semi-formed or liquid waste.\n\n(B) The patient has a colostomy.\nA colostomy is a surgical procedure that creates an opening in the large intestine (colon) by redirecting it through the abdominal wall, allowing stool to pass out of the body. Due to the type of waste produced in a colostomy, patients often use closed pouches to collect and dispose of the waste.\n\n(C) In the immediate post-operative period.\nIn the immediate post-operative period, it's common for patients to have various tubes or drains to manage bleeding, fluid, and other output from the surgical site. Closed pouches can be applied here to help manage waste during this period.\n\n(D) The patient has a urostomy.\nA urostomy is a surgery that creates an opening in the urinary system by redirecting it through the abdominal wall, allowing urine to pass out of the body.

The factors provided are anaerobic contribution, pH of the muscle, blood glucose concentration, and relative contribution of aerobic metabolism.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each option separately\n\nOption A - Anaerobic contribution progressively increases with increasing number of sprints:\nSprinting is an anaerobic activity, which means that it relies on non-oxygen power sources in the muscles. As sprints increase, the energy demand from anaerobic pathways would increase to maintain the required power output.\n\nOption B - pH of the muscle falls below 6.0:\nDuring anaerobic exercise, lactic acid levels rise, which can cause a small drop in the pH of the muscle. However, this doesn't necessarily have to be an ongoing, progressive process as the body has ways to mitigate the acidity with more aerobic exercise.\n\nOption C - Blood glucose concentration falls below 3 mmol/L:\nSprinting involves using glucose as a fuel source from the blood or muscle glycogen stores. As sprints increase, blood glucose levels will fall, especially if there is no additional source of glucose available during or after exercise.\n\nOption D - Relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases:\nDuring sprinting, the body relies on anaerobic metabolism, which is less efficient than aerobic metabolism and cannot last as long. With progressive sprinting, the body might attempt to switch from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism to create a more sustainable energy source, though aerobic metabolism will never dominate over anaerobic metabolism in sprinting.\n\nStep 3: Determine the final answer\nConsidering all the given options, the one that mostly aligns with the increase in the number of sprints is Option A: \"anaerobic contribution progressively increases\" as sprinting predominantly relies on anaerobic metabolism.\n\nAnswer: A",

If one eye is covered, it makes sense that diplopia cannot occur, as the brain would only receive a signal from one eye, not allowing double vision.\n\n(B) The outer image is always the false image.\n- In some cases, the outer image might be considered \"false\" due to the visual misalignment caused by diplopia. However, the statement cannot be concluded as universally true for all cases of diplopia and situations.\n\n(C) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards.\n- It is true that patients with a fourth nerve palsy can experience double vision when looking upwards. However, this statement seems more specific to fourth nerve palsy and not necessarily relevant to all cases of diplopia.\n\n(D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint.\n- Sixth nerve palsy, also known as abducens nerve palsy, can cause double vision due to impairment in the eye movement. However, a divergent squint is a misalignment where one eye is turned outward. So, not every instance of sixth nerve palsy would cause a divergent squint.\n\nBased on the analysis above, only statement (A) is always true in the context of diplopia.\n\n(A) Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered.",

Sodium bicarbonate is a base substance, which means it can help neutralize acidity.\n2. During exercise, hydrogen ions (a result of lactic acid) build up in muscle, causing muscle fatigue.\n3. If we can remove (efflux) these hydrogen ions more quickly, it may help delay muscle fatigue and improve performance.\n4. By elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid (the fluid outside the cells), sodium bicarbonate makes it less acidic and improves the ability to neutralize acidic byproducts, which in return helps remove hydrogen ions from muscles more efficiently during exercise.\n5.
