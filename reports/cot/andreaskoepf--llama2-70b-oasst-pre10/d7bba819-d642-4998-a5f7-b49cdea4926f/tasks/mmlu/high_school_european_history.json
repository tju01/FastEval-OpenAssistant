            "model_answer": "Let's analyze the passage step-by-step to deduce Huxley's perspective on life.\n\n1. Huxley begins by translating the term \"Protoplasm\" as \"the physical basis of life,\" indicating that he's discussing tangible, physical aspects of life.\n\n2. He considers the idea of a physical basis of life to be novel, as there's a widespread conception of life as something that works through matter (without being an intrinsic property of it).\n\n3. Huxley explains that the matter of life breaks up into carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds, which have ordinary material properties.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Huxley views life as a physical, tangible aspect (contrary to a force or philosophical notion).\n- He argues against the widespread view of life as something that works through matter without being an intrinsic property.\n- He emphasizes that the matter of life has ordinary material properties.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the most appropriate answer is:\n(C) merely a property of a certain kind of matter",

He discusses the \"game of human life\" being wretched, expressing a view that life is unpredictable and fraught with danger.\n\n3.

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?\n\n(A) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.\n(B) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.\n(C) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.\n(D) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported King Louis's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, while he removed their power.",
