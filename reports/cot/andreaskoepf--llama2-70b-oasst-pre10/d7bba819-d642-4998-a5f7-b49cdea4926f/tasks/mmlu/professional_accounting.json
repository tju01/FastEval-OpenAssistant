            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Calculate daily income\nTo calculate the daily income, we need to multiply the hourly rate ($245) by the average number of hours the limousine is hired per day (2 hours). \nDaily income = $245 * 2 = $490\n\nStep 2: Calculate daily costs\nWe have been given an average daily cost of $50. \n\nStep 3: Calculate daily profit\nNow, we subtract the daily costs from the daily income to get the daily profit. \nDaily profit = Daily income - Daily costs\nDaily profit = $490 - $50 = $440\n\nStep 4: Calculate yearly profit\nSince the limousine operates every day of the year, we multiply the daily profit by the number of days in a year (365). \nYearly profit = Daily profit * Number of days in a year\nYearly profit = $440 * 365 = $162,640\n\nStep 5: Calculate yearly yield\nNow we can calculate the yearly yield as the percentage of the investment cost ($98,000) in the yearly profit ($162,640). \nYearly yield = (Yearly profit / Investment cost) * 100\nYearly yield = ($162,640 / $98,000) * 100 = 1.64%\n\nThe correct answer is: (B) 1.64%",

As the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory, the inventory balance would be accurate.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the impact of the omission on the Accounts Payable account.\nThe Accounts Payable account was not increased as the credit purchase of merchandise was not recorded, resulting in unpaid liabilities from the supplier.\n\nStep 4: Determine the overall effect on the balance sheet.\nAs the effect on the inventory balance is accurate, the total assets remain unaffected. However, the Accounts Payable balance is understated because of the unrecorded credit purchase of merchandise.\n\nStep 5: Identify the choice that represents the effect on the balance sheet.\nIn summary, Arno Co.'s balance sheet at year-end would have no effect on total assets and an understated liabilities section, due to the unrecorded credit purchase.

Sampling risk: The risk that the auditor's results may be incorrect due to the nature of the samples selected (related to choosing specific items for audit procedures)\n2. Nonsampling risk: The risk that the auditor may draw incorrect conclusions due to factors not related to sample selection (related to factors other than choosing specific items for audit procedures)\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement in relation to a nonissuer (a company that does not issue financial instruments such as stocks or bonds):\n\n(A) This statement talks about nonsampling risk and how conclusions can differ based on sample size rather than testing each item (sampling risk).\n(B) This statement addresses nonsampling risk due to an auditor's inability to recognize misstatements.\n(C) This statement describes sampling risk and how applying audit procedures to specific risks leads to uncertainty.\n(D) This statement considers sampling risk related to selecting inappropriate audit procedures.\n\nThe correct statement in the context of audit sampling risks for a nonissuer is (B) Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements. This is true, as nonsampling risk is relevant to the auditor's ability to identify misstatements during the audit, while the other statements discuss sampling risks.\n\nSo the answer is (B).",

Auditors often need to verify inventory levels and values. Inspecting items that were ordered before but arrived after the year end could potentially impact the financial statements' accuracy, and thus requires the auditor's attention.\n\n(B) Test internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate.\nWhile auditors do assess the effectiveness of internal controls to ensure they are functioning properly, this procedure does not directly address subsequent events. Instead, it is a more general assessment of the company's controls up to the year-end.\n\n(C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.\nThis procedure is a direct assessment of subsequent events, as auditors need to ensure the accuracy of transactions and balances after the year-end in the bank statements. Reviewing bank statements for several months after the year end helps verify account balances are correct, transactions are properly recorded, and the financial statements are accurate.\n\n(D) Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited.\nWhile this procedure may help detect errors in the financial statements being audited, it does not directly address subsequent events that might have occurred after the year end.\n\nIn conclusion, the most appropriate procedure an auditor would generally perform regarding subsequent events is:\n(C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.",
