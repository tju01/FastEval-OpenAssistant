            "question": "Which State ordinarily exercises jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels?\n\n(A) The coastal State\n(B) The flag State\n(C) All States enjoy such jurisdiction\n(D) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let us first understand each option:\n\n(A) The coastal State: Refers to the state next to a particular coastline.\n(B) The flag State: Refers to the state under whose flag a vessel is registered.\n(C) All States enjoy such jurisdiction: Implies that any state can exercise such jurisdiction.\n(D) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea: Refers to an international court for the determination of disputes under UNCLOS.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option.\n\n(A) The coastal State: In the oceans, the coastal state enjoys jurisdiction over its exclusive economic zone (EEZ). However, in international waters, they don't have jurisdiction over crimes committed onboard vessels.\n\n(B) The flag State: According to international law, the flag state exercises jurisdiction over crimes committed onboard vessels it has registered, regardless of whether the vessel is in territorial waters or international waters. This is known as \"flag state jurisdiction\".\n\n(C) All States enjoy such jurisdiction: While states have the right to exercise jurisdiction within their territories, not all states have jurisdiction in international waters.\n\n(D) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea: This international court resolves disputes among states under UNCLOS, but doesn't exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed onboard vessels.\n\nBased on the analysis, we can understand that the flag state exercises jurisdiction over crimes committed onboard vessels it has registered, both in territorial waters and international waters. So, the answer is:\n\n(B)",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The meaning of justiciability is as follows:\n\n(A) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders. This means that justiciability is concerned with whether a court can effectively adjudicate issues related to a specific right. If a right is justiciable, it means that a court can review and decide if the right has been violated, and take appropriate action to remedy the situation.\n\n(B) is not the correct definition because it focuses on the just or fair nature of a right, rather than its enforceability by a court.\n\n(C) is not the correct definition because it focuses on the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a right conforms to principles of justice. While this may be a factor in determining justiciability, it is not the definition itself.\n\n(D) is not the correct definition because it focuses on the state's obligation to enforce a right, rather than the ability of the courts to address it.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the correct definition of justiciability is (A). Hence, my response would be (A).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to compare Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and humanitarian intervention and determine how they differ from each other. Let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention\nThis statement is not accurate. Although R2P and humanitarian intervention might seem similar, they have different principles and criteria for implementation.\n\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress\nThis option is also incorrect. R2P does not require a call for assistance by the State in distress. It is based on the responsibility of the international community to protect populations from four types of atrocity crimes: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity.\n\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\nThis option is the most accurate in describing the differences between R2P and humanitarian intervention. R2P is a framework that requires international involvement, particularly from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), to prevent or halt large-scale human rights violations. The primary goal of R2P is to avert a humanitarian crisis, while humanitarian intervention can have broader or different objectives.\n\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not\nThis statement is not correct. R2P does not necessarily involve the use of armed force. It can include various non-military measures, such as diplomatic pressure, economic sanctions, and humanitarian assistance, to protect populations at risk.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis",

This interpretation of the Lotus principle seems accurate.\n\n(B) This option seems to be a misinterpretation of the Lotus principle. It instead describes the choice of forum for settling international disputes, not the Lotus principle itself.\n\n(C) This option focuses on the enforcement jurisdiction States can assert on the high seas. Although it is related to the concepts in international law, it does not accurately describe the Lotus principle.\n\n(D) This option states that customary law derives from the combination of State practice and opinio juris, which is a general principle of international law, but it does not directly address the Lotus principle.\n\nBased on my analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) The so-called Lotus principle is that 'restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed', or, as it has been construed, 'whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law'.",

This statement is not entirely accurate.\n\n(B) The UK Constitution, although uncodified, does give the judiciary some power to interpret laws, albeit not the power to overturn acts of parliament directly, it could however, imprison individuals for breaking laws. So, this statement is misleading.\n\n(C) The UK Constitution is uncodified, as it's also called an 'unwritten' or 'uncodified' constitution, meaning it's not written in a single types of documents or legal instruments. It consists of various historical texts, court rulings, official agreements, and political practices. This statement accurately describes the UK Constitution.\n\n(D) The UK Constitution, while influential in its development, is not solely based on a Bill of Rights. Additionally, the UK doesn't have a comprehensive Bill of Rights like the United States.

This does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes\n(C) It is a peremptory norm of international law and all States have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute\n(D) It is an obligation which concerns solely international courts and tribunals",

This understanding fails to capture the essence of the obligation, which is about the process of resolving disputes peacefully rather than the time it takes to reach a resolution.\n\nOption B: An 'obligation of conduct' focuses on the actions taken by states and the means used to resolve disputes. In this case, states have an obligation to try to resolve disputes through peaceful means. This option aligns with the principle of peaceful settlement in international law.\n\nOption C: Peremptory norms (also known as jus cogens) are fundamental principles that most states agree upon. While the peaceful settlement of disputes is essential, framing it as a peremptory norm gives it a broader scope, encompassing other elements of international law. Thus, this option may be too wide-ranging for the specific obligation in question.\n\nOption D: International courts and tribunals play a role in the peaceful settlement of disputes, but the obligation of peaceful settlement primarily concerns states' conduct rather than the institutional framework.\n\nStep 3: Identify the most accurate and relevant option based on the evaluation.\n\nBased on the evaluation, Option B best describes the obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes.\n\nAnswer: (B) It is an obligation of conduct, that is, states have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means.

Changing the requirement for a case to be declared admissible from a unanimous decision by a committee of three judges to a single decision by a judge.\n3.

Protocol 14 amended the requirement for a case to be declared admissible, changing it from a unanimous decision by a committee of three judges to a single decision by a judge.\n\n(B) Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility\nThis statement is false. Protocol 14 did not introduce any new admissibility criterion but rather simplified the process by having a single judge make the admissibility decision.\n\n(C) Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights\nThis statement is false. Protocol 14 did not abolish the Commission of Human Rights. The Commission was actually abolished when the European Union established the Fundamental Rights Agency in 2007.\n\n(D) Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights\nThis statement is true.

It is a non-treaty based mechanism, as it stems from the General Assembly resolution and not directly from any single international human rights treaty.\n\n(D) The UN special mandates: These are special procedures established by the UN Human Rights Council, such as Special Rapporteurs and Working Groups.
