            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze the given answer choices:\n\n(A) Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime\n(B) Traditional currency, Cheap, Unsecure, Charitable giving\n(C) Cryptocurrencies, Cheap, Secure, Financial crime\n(D) Traditional currency, Expensive, Unsecure, Charitable giving\n\nStep 1: Identify the subject in the question.\nThe subject in question is \"such as bitcoin,\" which refers to cryptocurrencies.\n\nStep 2: Eliminate options that do not relate to cryptocurrencies.\nBetween options(B) and (D), we eliminate option(D) because it suffers from a logical inconsistency (\"Financial Crime\" doesn't typically relate to charitable actions).\n\nStep 3: Eliminate options that are untrue for the subject.\nOption(A) says cryptocurrencies are expensive. This is true as cryptocurrencies exhibit high volatility and prices, often making them seem expensive, which is a negative aspect.\nOption(B) says traditional currency is cheap, and there is financial crime, but it does not mention the aspect of cryptocurrencies being secure.\n\nStep 4: Choose the answer that not only aligns but also disputes with the provided information.\nOption(C) says cryptocurrencies are cheap, secure, and admit to having financial crime issues. This option is aimed directly at the subject and reveals both a positive and a negative side, which is what the question asks for.\n  \nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Cryptocurrencies, Cheap, Secure, Financial crime.

Now evaluating each option:\n   A. Employee rights: These are what the employer owes to their employees, not the other way around. So, this is not the correct option.\n   B. Employee rights: This is duplicate of option A, so it is also not correct.\n   C. Employer duties: These are what the employers owe to their employees, not the worker's obligations towards their employer. So, this is not the correct option.\n   D.

            "model_answer": "Let's break down the question step-by-step:\n\n1. The question is asking for limitations and risks of business-CSO collaborations.\n2. The parenthesis needs us to provide a single letter for each of the three problems.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Power imbalance, Benefits, Hoodwinked\n- Power imbalance refers to unequal distribution of resources and power between parties.\n- Benefits refers to unfair distribution of advantages gained from a relationship.\n- Hoodwinked is not a commonly used term. In less formal contexts, it may refer to being fooled or deceived, but it's not the most suitable option in this context.\n\nB. Power imbalance, Resources, Co-opted\n- Power imbalance, again referring to unequal distribution of resources and power.\n- Resources focus more on what is controlled or owned by one party.\n- Co-opted refers to when mass organizations become influenced or manipulated by a more powerful organization (which could capture the business-CSO collaborations context).\n\nC. Informational asymmetries, Benefits, Hoodwinked\n- Informational asymmetries are when one party has more information than the other, leading to an imbalance.\n- Benefits, as mentioned earlier, focus on the unequal distribution of advantages gained from a relationship.\n- Hoodwinked, as mentioned before, is not suitable in the context of a business-CSO collaboration.\n\nD. Informational asymmetries, Resources, Co-opted\n- Informational asymmetries, referring to unequal access to information.\n- Resources, as mentioned before, is more related to what is controlled or owned by one party.\n- Co-opted, as mentioned before, highlights the manipulation of mass organizations.\n\nConsidering all the above limitations and selecting the best terms:\n\nOption B appears to be the most accurate answer, as it covers the limitations of business-CSO collaborations by specifically mentioning power imbalance, resources, and co-opted. \n\nSo the answer is: \n(B)",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze each normative theory:\n\n(A) Hedonistic Utilitarianism: This theory focuses on maximizing overall pleasure and minimizing overall pain for everyone affected. It does not specifically focus on corporate profit maximization, but instead aims to improve the general well-being of all individuals.\n\n(B) Preference Utilitarianism: This theory also focuses on overall well-being, but its emphasis is on the satisfaction of individual preferences. While it may have some relation to corporate profit maximization because satisfying preferences could lead to increased profits, it does not directly prescribe profit maximization as a goal.\n\n(C) The Categorical Imperative: This is a moral principle developed by Immanuel Kant, which emphasizes the importance of acting in accordance with one's duties and good will, regardless of the consequences. Corporate profit maximization is not the main focus of the Categorical Imperative.\n\n(D) Ethics of Care: This theory emphasizes the importance of empathy, understanding, and nurturing in moral decision-making. It prioritizes care for others and is not directly related to corporate profit maximization.\n\nBased on the analysis above, corporate profit maximization is most similar to neither of the provided options (A, B, C, or D). However, among the given choices, profit maximization is closest to option (A) hedonistic utilitarianism because both hedonistic utilitarianism and profit maximization involve balancing cost-benefit outcomes. Profit maximization is still not directly prescribed by hedonistic utilitarianism, but it is the closest match among the provided options.\n\nAnswer: (A) hedonistic utilitarianism",

He argued that by focusing on making profits for their shareholders, businesses create a more prosperous society as a whole.\n\nNow let's go step by step through the answer choices:\n\n(A) The only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders: This statement aligns with Milton Friedman's beliefs. He argued that businesses should focus on increasing profits for their shareholders and not get involved in social issues.\n\n(B) Managers should act in ways that balance the interest of society and shareholders: This statement goes against Friedman's view. He believed that by focusing on shareholders, businesses inadvertently contribute to the welfare of society. Balancing the interests of society and shareholders is not in line with his beliefs.\n\n(C) The primary responsibility organizations have is to its employees: This statement is not in agreement with Milton Friedman's beliefs. He believed that the primary responsibility was towards shareholders, not employees.\n\n(D) The primary responsibility organizations have is to its stakeholders: This statement is not in alignment with Friedman's views.

The sentence states that something \"goes further than the (blank) that CSOs have with businesses\". This indicates the first blank should be filled with a term that is related to CSOs and businesses.\n3. To understand what can \"go further\" than interactions, we need to determine which choice refers to a kind of management or relationship between different entities. \n4. Mechanics (A), Outcomes (B and C), and Relations (B) can be related to interactions between CSOs and businesses. Outcomes, being the result of such interactions, seems the most suitable here.\n5. However, we need to also consider the second option, which is the kind of regulation or activity concerned with these outcomes.\n6. Regulation should be associated with something that controls or monitors the activities for some objective. So we are likely looking for options that do not directly relate to these interactions but may regulate their outcomes.\n7. Mechanics and Interactions seem to follow a direct relationship with the interactions between CSOs and businesses. Outcomes indicate an actual result related to these interactions.\n8. Out of the four choices, \"Outcomes\" makes the most sense - as they describe the end products of interactions and relationships.\n\nSo the completed sentence would be: \"______ regulation goes further than the ______ that CSOs have with businesses, as it also concerns _______of such processes.\" The final answer is:\n\n(C) Political, Interactions, Outcomes",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's examine each option and its relation to the given description of working practices:\n\n1. Dynamic working practices: This option may sound relevant since it suggests fluctuations in the work process. However, \"dynamic\" usually implies constant progress or change, while the given description focuses on fluidity in terms of time, space, and tasks. So, this option is less likely to be the correct answer.\n\n2. Fluid working practices: \"Fluid\" is an apt descriptor for practices that involve temporal, spatial, and task-related fluidity \u2013 that is, practices that are not fixed but can change, adapt, and adjust according to various factors. This option seems to be the best match for the given description.\n\n3. Flexible working practices: While \"flexible\" does demonstrate a close association with the description, it might not fully encompass the temporal, spatial, and task-related fluidity mentioned. The word \"flexible\" suggests adaptability, but it might imply adjustments to only one or two aspects of work. Therefore, this option is also less likely to be the correct answer.\n\n4. Modern working practices: Although the term \"modern\" can be associated with innovative forms of working, it does not explicitly imply temporal, spatial, and task-related fluidity. Instead, \"modern\" focuses on the timeliness or the latest trends, which does not perfectly match the given description.\n\nBased on the analysis of each option, the best fitting answer would be:\n\n(B) Fluid",
