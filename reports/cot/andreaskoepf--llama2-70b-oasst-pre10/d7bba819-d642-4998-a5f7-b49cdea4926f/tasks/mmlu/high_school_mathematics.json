            "model_answer": "Step 1: Determine the general formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence of consecutive odd integers.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence is:\nSum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2\n\nGiven that the consecutive odd integers have a common difference of 2, we know that these integers can be represented as a sequence of numbers in arithmetic progression with a start value a, and a common difference of 2. In this case, we have:\n\na, a + 2, a + 4, a + 6, ...\n\nNow, we need to find the value of a (the beginning of the sequence) that will result in a sum of 240. Thus, we have:\n\n240 = (n * (n + 1)) / 2\n\nStep 2: Solve the equation for n.\n\n960 = n * (n + 1)\n\nNow, we need to factorize 960 to find the smallest factor combination that gives us an integer:\n\n960 = 2^5 * 3^1\n\nWe need an odd number for n, so let's test possibilities starting with (n+1) as an odd multiple of 3:\n\n(3 * 3 * 3) / 2 = 162\n(3 * 3 * 5) / 2 = 225\n(3 * 3 * 7) / 2 = 306\n(3 * 3 * 9) / 2 = 387\n(3 * 3 * 11) / 2 = 448\n(3 * 3 * 13) / 2 = 521.5\n\nSince there is no integer value for n greater than 13 that gives an integer result, we cannot use the larger prime numbers. So, the only solution within our range is n = 9.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate if any other value of n results in a sum of 240.\n\nSince the smallest factor combination of 960 is 2^5 * 3^1 and it does not have an even multiple in the list to satisfy the condition n * (n + 1) = 960 with integer results, the sequence with n = 9 is the only possible sequence that has a sum of 240.\n\nStep 4: Output the answer.\n\nOur analysis indicates that there is only one arithmetic sequence of consecutive odd integers that sums to 240. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(A) 8",
