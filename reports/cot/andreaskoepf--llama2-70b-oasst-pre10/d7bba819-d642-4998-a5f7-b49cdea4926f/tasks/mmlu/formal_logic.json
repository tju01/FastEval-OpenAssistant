            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's break down the argument step by step and identify the conclusion it is leading to.\n\nStep 1:\nThe statement (A) states that \"it is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients.\" This implies that people (both peers and patients) are generally influenced negatively by their emotions, leading to a decrease in their intelligence.\n\nStep 2:\nWe move on to statement (B), which states that \"the arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes.\" This means that the strong defense mechanisms, namely consciousness, block the unconscious complexes from being acknowledged or understood.\n\nStep 3:\nNow, we look at statement (C) saying that \"because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\" Essentially, it is hard for people to accept the existence of unconscious processes because their consciousness blocks such thoughts.\n\nStep 4:\nFinally, we can deduce the conclusion from the argument. Considering all the provided statements, it can be concluded that people have difficulty accepting and understanding the unconscious concepts due to the strong defense mechanisms of consciousness.\n\nBased on the provided statements and the reasoning outlined above, the final line would be:\n\n(D) It is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.",
