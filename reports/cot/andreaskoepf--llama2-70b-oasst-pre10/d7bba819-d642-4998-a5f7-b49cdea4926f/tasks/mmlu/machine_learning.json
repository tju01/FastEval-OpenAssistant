            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze both statements step by step.\n\nStatement 1: Linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.\n- Linear regression estimator is a technique used in statistics and machine learning to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.\n- An unbiased estimator is a statistical estimator that is expected to equal the true value of the parameter it is estimating, on average over repeated sampling.\n- The variance of an estimator measures the amount of variability or dispersion in the estimates. A lower variance indicates that the estimator is more precise.\n- The statement claims that the linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators. This is not true, as other unbiased estimators with smaller variances exist, such as maximum likelihood estimators.\n\nStatement 2: The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\n- AdaBoost is a machine learning algorithm that combines several weak learners into a strong learner.\n- The algorithm assigns weights, known as coefficients \u03b1, to each classifier.\n- These coefficients are used to calculate the overall prediction of the strong learner.\n- In AdaBoost, the coefficients \u03b1 are indeed non-negative, as the algorithm works by assigning positive weights to classifiers that perform well and subtracting weights from those that perform poorly. This ensures that the strong learner is composed of the best performing weak learners.\n- Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nConsidering the above reasoning, we can now proceed to find the answer:\n\nSince Statement 1 is False and Statement 2 is True, the final line should contain the answer: (D) False, True.",

According to its paper and studies comparing RoBERTa and BERT, Roberta was pre-trained on a massive corpus containing 160GB of text, while BERT was trained on a much smaller corpus with only 3.3B tokens or approximately 16GB of text. This information supports that RoBERTa was indeed pre-trained on a larger corpus compared to BERT.\n\nStatement 2: ResNeXts in 2018 usually used tanh activation functions.\n\nResNeXt is a specific type of ResNet-style architecture designed for computer vision tasks aimed to improve network capacity and improve handling of feature maps. The original paper on ResNeXt (2016) mentions the use of residual connections and skip connections, SKIP, residual identity mapping, along with ReLU activation functions. However, there is no explicit mention of tanh activation functions in the ResNeXt model.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer would be:\n\n(C) True, False",

This statement is correct since both SVMs and logistic regression models are used for classification tasks and output class probabilities.\n\nStatement 2 claims that we would expect the support vectors to remain the same in general as we move from a linear kernel to higher-order polynomial kernels. This statement refers to the SVM's ability to handle different types of kernels, including linear and polynomial. The use of higher-order polynomial kernels generally increases model complexity and flexibility, potentially changing the support vectors, which are the data points that define the decision boundary.

Convolutional networks are known for being widely used in computer vision applications, particularly image classification and recognition.\n\n(B) Graph networks: Graph neural networks (GNNs) process graphical or relational data where nodes are connected by edges that have different weights. GNNs are effective in learning node embeddings, which capture node relationships in a graph.

Although fully connected networks are part of more complex architectures like ConvNets, they are not specifically created for image classification.\n\n(D) RBF networks (Radial Basis Function networks): RBF networks are feedforward neural networks that use a set of basis functions, such as radius or proximity. Although they have been used for classification tasks, they are not typically applied to high-resolution image data.\n\nBased on this analysis, convolutional networks (A) are the best architecture for classifying high-resolution images as of 2020, due to their specialization in processing and learning from hierarchical features in image data.",

We'll go through each statement step by step.\n\nStatement 1: The log-likelihood of the data will always increase through successive iterations of the expectation maximation algorithm.\n\nThe Expectation Maximization algorithm is an iterative algorithm used in machine learning to estimate parameters in generative models. The algorithm performs alternating numerical optimization steps through expectation and maximization. The log-likelihood of the data is calculated at each iteration, with the increase in log-likelihood indicating better modeling of the data. However, it's not guaranteed that the log-likelihood of the data will always increase. There can be cases where the log-likelihood may converge to an optimal value or even decrease, depending on the divergence between the actual and estimated parameters. As a result, this statement is false.\n\nStatement 2: One disadvantage of Q-learning is that it can only be used when the learner has prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment.\n\nQ-learning is a form of reinforcement learning where a learning agent attempts to learn a policy that maximizes it's reward in an environment. One significant advantage of Q-learning is that it does not require prior knowledge of the environment or how its actions affect the environment. The learner simultaneously updates the estimates of future rewards and the value function by observing the environment and performing trial-and-error explorations. Thus, this statement is false.\n\nNow we can conclude by combining the results of the analysis:\nTrue, False \u2192 (C) True, False",

Since we have to subtract the gradient from the weights, the time complexity would depend on the size of the gradient vector g and the size of the weights vector x.\n\n3. To compute the gradient, we have to process each training example in the dataset. This results in an estimate for the change in loss based on an example.\n\n4. The gradient vector, g, therefore has the same dimensions as the weights vector, x. If the weights are of size D, then the gradient vector would be of size D as well.\n\n5. In order to subtract the gradient from the weights, we would need to analyze each element of the weights matrix and multiply it by the corresponding element in the gradient vector. This requires O(D) computations for each of the weights.\n\n6. Since we do this for each weight, the time complexity is O(D * N), where N is the number of weights.\n\n7.
