            "question": "You are the vice president of public relations for a corporation that produces a well-known brand of food products. In the Albany, New York, market, one of your products has recently been found to have some contamination. While apparently not fatal, it has given a large number of consumers severe stomach cramps and other intestinal problems. The cause has been traced back to your product, which is sold throughout the nation. Your CEO wants to know what you would advise to keep the situation from becoming a public relations disaster. What should you recommend?\n\n(A) Quickly investigate to make certain your product is definitely the cause of the illness.\n(B) Stop all sales of the product throughout the nation and issue a recall for that product.\n(C) Stop sales of the product in the Albany, New York, market and issue a recall for that product.\n(D) Issue a press release to the Albany, New York, market explaining how to treat the symptoms.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To tackle this situation, I would recommend the following steps:\n\n1. First, we should verify that our product is indeed the cause of the illness. This would involve a thorough investigation using the information provided and collaborating with health officials in the Albany, New York area. It would be essential to not make any assumptions at this point and to rely on factual data to make informed decisions. This can be performed parallel to the other steps.\n\n2. Once it has been confirmed that our product is the cause of the illness, we should stop all sales of the product throughout the nation and issue a recall for that product (Option B). This would show that we take responsibility for the issue and prioritize the safety of our customers. Issuing a nationwide recall implies that no matter where the product is available, we're making an effort to prevent further harm to consumers.\n\n3. To ensure more effective communication with customers, we should issue a press release to the Albany, New York market, as well as to the entire nation, explaining how to treat the symptoms (Option D). This is important because it demonstrates our commitment to addressing the issue and helping those affected get the necessary information to alleviate their symptoms.\n\nIn conclusion, based on these steps, the answer would be an amalgamation of options B (Stop all sales of the product throughout the nation and issue a recall for that product) and D (Issue a press release to the Albany, New York, market explaining how to treat the symptoms). However, since there is limited space to provide answers, I will choose the one-letter answer based on the primary action needed to protect the brand of the corporation, which is to:\n\n(B) Stop all sales of the product throughout the nation and issue a recall for that product.",

Hendrix (2002): His planning model consists of five stages: (1) environmental scanning, (2) strategy formulation, (3) strategy implementation, (4) strategy evaluation, and (5) strategic renewal.\n\n2. Kendall (1999): Kendall's model has five main elements within the management process: (1) planning, (2) organizing, (3) controlling, (4) implementing, and (5) evaluating.\n\n3. Merston (1963): Merston's model is an Economic Order Quantity model which involves (1) forecasting, (2) planning, (3) initiating production, (4) controlling processes, (5) distribution and allocation, and (6) evaluation and control.\n\n4. Parkinson and Ekachai (2006): According to them, there are four main stages of strategic management: (1) strategic analysis, (2) strategic formulation, (3) strategy implementation, and (4) strategy evaluation.\n\nComparing the four models, we can see that \"strategy implementation\" (or \"implementing\") is present in all four. The second common element seems to be \"evaluation\" (or \"evaluating\"). Thus, the answer is:\n\n(D) Objectives and Implementation (we might assume the \"objectives\" aspect refers to \"strategy formulation\" in Seg\u00fan Parkinson y Ekachai (2006) est\u00e1 en ingl\u00e9s en el articulo en cuesti\u00f3n pero se refiere a la formulaci\u00f3n de estrategia)",

The organization acknowledges its mistake and apologizes, while also providing assurance that redemption steps are being taken.\n2. Ingratiation: The organization develops positive relationships with publics by framing its communication in ways that doesn't implicate the organization as the source of the problem.\n3. Downplaying: The organization emphasizes low-, no-, or negative-risk perception in the crisis.\n4. Distancing: The organization highlights the qualities that differentiate it from the crisis by distancing itself from the problem.\n\nStep 2: Compare the answer choices with the categories\n\nNow that we have the four categories, we can compare them to the answer choices given:\n\n(A) ingratiation: This is one of the four categories\n(B) downplaying: This is also one of the four categories\n(C) distancing: This too is one of the four categories\n(D) nonexistence: Not found among the four categories\n\nStep 3: Provide the answer\n\nBased on the comparison in Step 2, we can identify that (D) nonexistence is the answer, as it is NOT one of the four categories of persuasive crisis communication strategies identified by W.
