            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "A Robertsonian translocation is a type of chromosomal rearrangement that occurs in humans and other animals. It is characterized by the complete fusion of two different acrocentric chromosomes (chromosomes with their centromeres situated near one end). We will evaluate each option to determine which one best fits the description of Robertsonian translocation fusion:\n\n(A) Telomeres: These are the ends of chromosomes, responsible for protecting the chromosome from damage. While telomeres are important for maintaining chromosomal stability, fusion in Robertsonian translocation occurs at a different location.\n\n(B) Centromeres: Centromeres are the regions of a chromosome that play a vital role in organizing chromosome structure and ensuring equal distribution of genetic material during cell division. In Robertsonian translocation, fusion occurs at the centromeres of two acrocentric chromosomes.\n\n(C) Histones: Histone proteins are responsible for packaging and organizing DNA into chromatin. While histones are essential for DNA structure, they are not the location of fusion in a Robertsonian translocation.\n\n(D) Ends of the long arms: This option describes the general location of the centromeres on an acrocentric chromosome. While fusion occurs on the ends of the long arms during a Robertsonian translocation, this option lacks the necessary specificity to be correct.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) centromeres.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question\nThe question asks for the expected frequency of affected females in a human population if the frequency of affected males is 0.10.\n\nStep 2: Define the variables\nLet M be the number of males in the population.\nLet F be the number of females in the population.\nWe want to find the expected frequency of affected females, which is the number of affected females divided by the total number of females in the population (i.e., the number of affected females/F).\n\nStep 3: Identify the relationship between males and females\nWe are given the frequency of males affected with the X-linked recessive condition, which is 0.10. We can use this information to calculate the expected frequency of affected females.\n\nStep 4: Understand how X-linked recessive conditions work\nIn X-linked recessive conditions, the alleles responsible for the condition are located on the X chromosome. Since males have one X chromosome (from their mother) and one Y chromosome (from their father), they are hemizygous and only express the allele responsible for the condition if they inherit the affected X chromosome. On the other hand, females have two X chromosomes (one from each parent) and are homozygous for the condition if they inherit two X chromosomes with the affected allele, or they are heterozygous if they inherit one affected X chromosome and one unaffected X chromosome.\n\nStep 5: Susceptibility to affected females\nIf the frequency of affected males is 0.10, it means that in every 10 males, one is affected by the condition. Since the condition affects only one out of every 10 males, we can assume that the frequency of affected females will be directly related to the frequency of affected males and will also follow the same ratio.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the frequency of affected females\nSince 1/10 = 10% of the males are affected, we can assume that 1% of the females are affected, since females have two X chromosomes rather than one like males do. In this case, M = F, as the condition affects 1% of the females.\n\nStep 7: Convert answer to a single letter with parenthesis\nNone of the given answer choices (A, B, C, or D) is in the required format (a single letter and a parenthesis).\n\nHowever, rearranging the answer to be in the expected format and only representing the number:\n\n(1) 0.01",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we will look at the basic structure of DNA and how the bases pair with each other. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) contains four main nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).\n\nThese bases form hydrogen bonds between specific pairs, which contribute to the stability of the DNA double helix. In a DNA molecule, adenine always pairs with one specific base due to the way they fit together:\n\n1. Adenine (A) can pair with cytosine (C): A and C can form three hydrogen bonds between their nitrogenous base functional groups, making them a strong pairing. \n2. Guanine (G) can pair with cytosine (C): G and C can also form three hydrogen bonds, making them a strong pairing as well.\n3. Guanine (G) can pair with thymine (T): G and T can form two hydrogen bonds.\n4. Adenine (A) can pair with thymine (T): A and T only form two hydrogen bonds.\n\nIn this case, we want to determine which base adenine normally pairs with:\n\n(A) Adenine with cytosine.\n(B) Adenine with guanine.\n(C) Adenine with thymine.\n(D) Adenine with uracil.\n\nUracil is a base found in RNA (ribonucleic acid) and doesn't pair with adenine in a DNA molecule, so we can eliminate option (D).\n\nNow, considering the stability afforded by the hydrogen bonds, Adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T) in DNA, forming two hydrogen bonds. Although adenine can also pair with cytosine, with three hydrogen bonds, this pairing is found in RNA, where one additional hydrogen bond ensures better stability under slightly different conditions.\n\nTherefore, in DNA, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Adenine with thymine (T)",

Autosomal dominant inheritance patterns are more common for genetic disorders resulting from mutations in non-sex-linked genes.\n\nBased on the information gathered, the inheritance pattern for malignant hyperthermia is most likely autosomal dominant.\n\nAnswer: (A) autosomal dominant.",

For example, parents who have experienced trauma, such as the violence of war, may have higher stress levels, which might be transmitted to their children during critical developmental periods. Environmental compounds such as toxin exposure from chemical weapons or pollution can also have intergenerational effects.\n\n(B) Natural disasters: Similar to war, natural disasters can introduce various stressors for parents, including trauma, economic instability, and inadequate resources. These stressors may in turn have an impact on the offspring, raising the likelihood of mental health problems or developmental difficulties. Related environmental risks or toxic exposures can also contribute to intergenerational transmission.\n\n(C) Hunger: Hunger, as an extreme form of malnutrition, can undoubtedly affect offspring through intergenerational transmission. Malnutrition in the parents can lead to compromised reproductive health, affecting the likelihood of having offspring. Furthermore, malnutrition during early life of the offspring can have significant consequences on their physical and mental development.\n\nBased on the analysis of each option, we can conclude that all the given factors can contribute to intergenerational transmission to offspring.\n\nAnswer: (D) all of these",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the risk of abnormality in a child with a mother who has untreated phenylketonuria.\n\n1. First, let's understand what phenylketonuria (PKU) is: It's a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down a compound called phenylalanine, an amino acid found in foods like meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products.\n\n2. If a mother has untreated PKU, her body will not be able to process phenylalanine properly, and the levels of this compound will spike in her bloodstream and can potentially pass through the placenta to the baby during pregnancy.\n\n3. Phenylalanine buildup in the baby's body can have severe consequences, such as developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and neurological problems.\n\n4. Now that we know the risks that untreated PKU could pose to the unborn child, let's look at the cohort that has the highest risk of having a child with abnormalities due to their mother's untreated PKU.\n\n5. Mothers with untreated PKU who conceive a child have approximately a 25% chance of having a child with severe PKU or abnormal phenylketonuria (APKU). This risk is increased if the father also has the PKU genetic mutation, where the chance of having a child with PKU could be as high as 50%.\n\n6.

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question\nThe question asks about exon skipping and wants us to identify which mutation type is associated with it. Exon skipping refers to the process by which certain exons present in pre-processed mRNA molecules are removed during RNA processing, leading to the final mature mRNA.\n\nStep 2: Eliminate irrelevant answers\n(A) Nonsense mutations: These mutations create a premature stop codon that leads to the production of an incomplete and non-functional protein. However, exon skipping deals with the removal of specific exons, not the creation of premature stop codons.\n(B) Regulatory mutations: These mutations involve the alteration of DNA sequences with regulatory functions, impacting the expression of genes. While they may affect the process of RNA maturation, they don't directly cause exon skipping.\n\nStep 3: Identify the correct answer\n(C) RNA processing mutations: These mutations involve errors during transcription or mRNA processing, including splicing, 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, exon skpping, and other modifications. Since exon skipping is a part of RNA processing, it is associated with this type of mutation.\n(D) Silent mutations: These mutations do not change the amino acids encoding the gene and do not have any observable effect on the organism.
