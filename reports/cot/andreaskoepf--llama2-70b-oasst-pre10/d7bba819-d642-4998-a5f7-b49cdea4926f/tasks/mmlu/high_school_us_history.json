Therefore, it could not have been an initiative with unfulfilled promises that led to desegregation.\n\n(B) The Square Deal - This policy was introduced by President Franklin D.

Like the Great Society, it cannot be the correct answer.\n\n(C) The New Deal - This was also introduced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s, but it occurred before the Brown v.

The goal of the New Deal was to help the United States recover from the Great Depression, and it included various social programs aimed at improving the living conditions of the poor and marginalized. However, when it came to civil rights for African Americans, the New Deal had some limitations and unfulfilled promises. Therefore, this initiative could be the one that led to desegregation as a response.\n\n(D) Reconstruction - This period occurred in the United States after the Civil War in the late 1860s. Its goal was to rebuild the nation and incorporate newly freed slaves into society. During Reconstruction, the 14th Amendment was introduced, which played a pivotal role in the Brown v.

The acts aimed to protect the U.S. from potential spies and nations who wanted to start a war against the new nation.
