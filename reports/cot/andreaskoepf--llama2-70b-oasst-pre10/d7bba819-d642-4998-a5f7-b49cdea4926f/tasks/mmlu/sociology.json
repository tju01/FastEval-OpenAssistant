            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's break down the question and analyze each option:\n\n1. The question is asking about the ecological approach to urban sociology. This means we should be looking for an explanation of the way people interact with the environment and live in cities.\n\n2. Let's go through each option and analyze them based on the theme of urban sociology and how they relate to the city's environment.\n\nOption (A): This option discusses how social groups colonize different areas of the city and compete for resources. It directly relates to the topic of urban sociology and how people interact with the environment. This option seems to be a strong candidate for the correct answer.\n\nOption (B): Although it mentions the city, this option is focused on wildlife and natural habitats and does not directly discuss how people interact with their environment from a sociological perspective. This is a weaker option, so it is not the best choice here.\n\nOption (C): Similarly to option (A), this option is discussing how people organize collective protests about environmental issues. However, the focus is more on environmental issues in general and not specifically on ecological interactions within the city's environment. This option is related but not specifically focused on the topic of urban sociology.\n\nOption (D): This option discusses how men and women use the city's public spaces differently. It is related to urban sociology, but it does not specifically discuss any ecological interactions or how people use the city's environment.\n\nBased on this analysis, the ecological approach to urban sociology involves studying:\n\n(A) how social groups colonized different areas of the city and competed for resources.",

It does not directly address Becker's stan regarding cannabis use\n\n(B) learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career\nThis statement suggests that cannabis use is learned through social interactions and adapted into deviant behavior, aligning more closely with Becker's perspective as a sociologist\n\n(C) a dangerous pastime that young people should not be allowed to pursue\nThis statement offers an opinion on the dangers of cannabis use and prohibiting young people from engaging in it, which may not necessarily reflect Becker's stance\n\n(D) not as enjoyable as other sociologists had suggested\nThis statement has Becker disagreeing with fellow sociologists regarding the enjoyment of cannabis use. However, more context about how Becker related cannabis use to sociology would be needed to properly evaluate this option.\n\nStep 3: Select the statement which most closely matches Becker's claim\nOut of the options, the most relevant statement seems to be (B) learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career. This statement is more in line with Becker's perspective as a sociologist focused on the social norms and deviant behavior.\n\nAnswer: (B) learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each option individually and see if they correctly describe the middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century.\n\n(A) an urban set, involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations\nThe middle class in the nineteenth century was mainly located in urban areas due to the need for tradesmen, merchants, managers, or professionals. Civic bodies and voluntary associations were indeed forming during this period, and the middle class played a significant role in their establishment and functioning. So, this option is correct.\n\n(B) too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness\n\"Middle class\" during the nineteenth century constitutes different types of professionals, artisans, and skilled workers. They were quite diverse, and their level of wealth, social standing, and values varied. Hence, it was difficult for all these diverse groups to have a strong class consciousness. Therefore, this option is also correct.\n\n(C) often involved in 'white collar' work\nIn the nineteenth century, the term \"white-collar\" work specifically referred to non-manual labor or work done in an office setting. Examples include clerks, professionals, and managers. The middle class mainly consisted of those performing white-collar work. Hence, this option is correct too.\n\nBased on the analysis of all three options, they all correctly describe the middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let us examine each option and determine if technological forms of surveillance have made it easier to accomplish the described tasks.\n\n(A) access and exchange 'private' information about consumers\n\nTechnological forms of surveillance, such as online tracking and data mining, have indeed made it easier to access and exchange private information about consumers. Companies can now collect and analyze large amounts of data on individuals' browsing habits, purchase history, and social media activity, often without their knowledge or consent. This information can then be used to target consumers with personalized advertisements and offers.\n\n(B) reduce prison overcrowding by the use of electronic tagging\n\nElectronic tagging is a form of surveillance that involves monitoring an individual's movements through a GPS-enabled device worn on their ankle. This system allows authorities to track a person's location 24/7 as a form of alternative punishment or to monitor individuals released from prison. As a result, electronic tagging can help reduce prison overcrowding by enabling early release for some individuals, while still maintaining a level of monitoring and control over their movements.\n\n(C) monitor employees' activities at work\n\nTechnological forms of surveillance have also made it easier to monitor employees' activities at work. Companies can now track employees' computer usage, monitor email correspondence, and even record video footage of their workspaces. This can be useful for increasing productivity, preventing theft or misconduct, and assessing employee performance.\n\nGiven these explanations, it can be concluded that technological forms of surveillance have indeed made it easier to:\n\n(A) access and exchange 'private' information about consumers\n(B) reduce prison overcrowding by the use of electronic tagging\n(C) monitor employees' activities at work\n\nTherefore, the answer is: (D) all of the above",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we will first explore the concept of Gemeinschaft and then compare it to the relational characteristics of the given options: organic solidarity, mechanical solidarity, gesellschaft, and anomie. \n\nGemeinschaft is a German term, which sociologist Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies used to describe a type of social association based on shared experiences, values, and culture, leading to strong interpersonal relationships. In simple terms, Gemeinschaft refers to a sense of community or belonging.\n\nNow let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) Organic solidarity: \u00c9mile Durkheim developed the concept of organic solidarity, which refers to individuals sharing common values and performing interdependent roles in society, leading to a sense of unity. This idea is similar to Gemeinschaft because both involve social cohesion and shared values.\n\n(B) Mechanical solidarity: Durkheim also developed the concept of mechanical solidarity to describe a type of social cohesion that arises when individuals share the same beliefs, values, and norms. While it is a form of unity, it is less concerned with interpersonal connections than organic solidarity.\n\n(C) Gesellschaft: Another concept developed by Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies. Gesellschaft represents the opposite of Gemeinschaft. Gesellschaft is a society that is based on rational, impersonal, and temporary associations for specific ends or purposes. Hence, this concept doesn't have similar relational characteristics as Gemeinschaft.\n\n(D) Anomie: This term was developed by \u00c9mile Durkheim and refers to a social condition where individuals feel isolated and socially disconnected. It is characterized by a lack of shared norms and values, which is different from the concept of Gemeinschaft.\n\nIn conclusion, after comparing the relational characteristics of the given options, the one that most closely resembles Gemeinschaft is (A) organic solidarity, as both involve individuals sharing common values and performing interdependent roles, leading to a sense of unity and belonging.",

            "question": "There was a growth in income inequality in the 1980s because:\n\n(A) rates of income tax increased equally for all occupational groups\n(B) there were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them\n(C) the price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings\n(D) growing unemployment made more people dependent on welfare benefits",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, I will analyze each option and choose the one that is most appropriate according to the given context.\n\nOption A: Rates of income tax increased equally for all occupational groups\n- This option does not indicate a growth in income inequality if tax rates increased equally for everyone. Equal taxation would not cause inequality, but rather maintain or even reduce it.\n\nOption B: There were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them\n- This option suggests an imbalance in the job market, favoring those with the right skills for the available jobs. This imbalance could lead to a growth in income inequality due to the uneven distribution of high-skilled jobs.\n\nOption C: The price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings\n- This option implies that the cost of living was increasing at a faster rate than income growth. An increased cost of living without corresponding increased earnings would lead to a decrease in disposable income, affecting lower-income groups more significantly, thus growing income inequality.\n\nOption D: Growing unemployment made more people dependent on welfare benefits\n- With unemployment growing and more people relying on welfare, this would likely lead to a reduction in disposable income levels for those affected and could further increase income inequality.\n\nAfter analyzing the options, Option C and D seem more relevant to the growth of income inequality. However, Option C focuses on the relationship between earnings and the cost of consumer goods which is more directly related to the problem. Therefore, the most appropriate answer, given the context, is:\n\n(C) the price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "At first, let's analyze each alternative to understand which one fits most accurately with the concept of 'normalized' deviant acts.\n\n(A) 'recognised as breaking an important norm of behaviour': If a deviant act is normalized, it means that it is no longer perceived as breaking a norm within the context it takes place in, so this option is not correct.\n\n(B) 'seen as a temporary aberration from an otherwise 'normal' character': While this might be true in some cases, it does not truly capture the essence of what happens when a deviant act is normalized. We're looking for an overall explanation of what happens when this type of act is considered accepted or not unusual in particular circumstances or communities.\n\n(C) 'the first step in establishing a deviant career': While the act could be a part of a deviant career, the term 'normalized' suggests a broader societal acceptance of the act rather than the start of an individual's deviant conduct.\n\n(D) 'attributed to the person's genetic or anatomical make up': Although some deviant behaviors could potentially be linked to genetical or anatomical factors, this doesn't describe what happens when a deviant act is normalized in a social context.\n\nSo, none of the alternatives directly and exactly corresponds to the concept of 'normalized' deviant act. However, given our analysis, option (A) is closest to describing the plot in which a deviant act (i.e., an act that originally breaks a societal norm) comes to be normalized to some extent, thereby no more breaking a norm in certain contexts.\n\nHence, the answer is:\n(A) recognised as breaking an important norm of behaviour.",
