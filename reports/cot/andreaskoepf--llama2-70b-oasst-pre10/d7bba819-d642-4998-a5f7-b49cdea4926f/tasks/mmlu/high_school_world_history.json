The passage is a keynote address given by Indonesian leader Sukarno during the Bandung Conference in 1955.\n2. The main focus of the speech is on the importance of preserving peace and the potential of mobilizing the strength of Asia and Africa for peace.\n3. It emphasizes solidarity between Asian and African countries and the power they could have if they work together for peace.\n\nNow, let's examine each option and see which one best fits with the information from the passage:\n\n(A) The formation of the Non-Aligned Movement - This is a plausible option since the Bandung Conference is known for being a founding moment for the Non-Aligned Movement, a group of countries that sought not to align with any major world powers during the Cold War.\n(B) Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation - While this is related to peace, the passage does not explicitly mention disarmament or nuclear non-proliferation.\n(C) The Green Revolution in agriculture - This option is not mentioned or related to the passage.\n(D) Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology - The passage does discuss mobilizing strength of Asian countries, but it also includes Africa, and focuses on peace, not an ideology.\n\nBased on this analysis, the passage is most associated with:\n\n(A) The formation of the non-aligned movement",

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes.

He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value.

Although it is possible that they came from other places in Asia, the passage doesn't confirm this.\n\n(D) The people in their court wore silk robes.\n- Silk is a widely recognized product from Asia, particularly China. It was an important trade commodity during the time when the book was written. Since the passage mentions that the court members were wearing silk robes, it is the most convincing evidence of Ghanaians being engaged, directly or indirectly, in trade with Asia.\n\nAnswer: (D) The people in his court wore silk robes.",

This decision led to the creation of a hypothetical line dividing zones within which Japanese forces would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities. As a result of this decision, Korea was divided into two separate nations: North Korea, which was under Soviet influence, and South Korea, which was under U.S. influence.

A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.
