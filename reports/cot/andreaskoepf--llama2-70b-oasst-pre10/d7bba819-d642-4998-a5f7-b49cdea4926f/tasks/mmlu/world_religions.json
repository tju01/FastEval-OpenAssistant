            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Identify the source language of the term 'murtis' to help in translation. In this case, the term 'murti' comes from the Hindu and Sanskrit languages.\n\nStep 2: Consider each of the answer options:\n\n(A) Offerings - This term reflects the act of giving or presenting something, often as a religious rite or to honor a deity. However, 'murti' doesn't typically refer to offerings in Hindu traditions.\n\n(B) Prayers - This term indicates communication with a higher power, usually through spoken or silent words. Though prayers are central to Hinduism, 'murti' isn't directly related to the idea of prayer.\n\n(C) Apparitions - This term signifies ghostly or spectral appearances. While some religious traditions include beliefs in apparitions, 'murti' doesn't align with this concept in the context of Hinduism.\n\n(D) Idols - This term denotes objects or images that are worshiped as divine or represent a deity. In Hinduism, 'murti' often represents a physical embodiment of a god or goddess, used for worship and rituals.\n\nStep 3: Determine which answer option is most accurate. Based on the analysis above, the term 'murti' can be translated as 'idols.'\n\nAnswer: (D) Idols",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Let's examine each option step by step to determine which is associated with naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes.\n\n(A) Daoism: Daoism is an ancient Chinese philosophy that emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao (\u9053), which can be translated as the \"Way.\" It teaches that people should observe and respond to the natural order and flow of the universe, placing importance on simplicity and non-interference. This option seems to align well with the description of naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes.\n\n(B) Yin-Yang School: The Yin-Yang School is a branch of Chinese philosophy. Yin and Yang symbolize the fundamental principle of opposition and balance in various aspects of life, including matter, energy, and time. While this philosophy considers the interactions between opposing forces, it is not specifically dedicated to naturalists focused on natural elements and processes.\n\n(C) Mengzi: Mengzi (also known as Mencius) was a Chinese philosopher who is associated with Confucianism. He is known for advocating humane governance and moral cultivation, which focuses on human virtues and relationships rather than natural elements and processes.\n\n(D) Humanistic Buddhism: Humanistic Buddhism is a term introduced by Taiwanese monk Hsing Yun. It emphasizes the integration of Buddhist teachings with humanistic values and life, rather than focusing on the natural elements and processes around us.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is (A) Daoism, as it is the closest to describing naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes.",

This could be a valid option.\n\n(B) Muhammad's migration to Mecca: The migration, or hijra, was when Muhammad moved from Mecca to Medina in 622 CE. This term is used to describe the event but it is not called \"Mi'raj.\" So, this option can be eliminated.\n\n(C) Muhammad's first community in Mecca: The mi'raj is not considered to be Muhammad's first community in Mecca.

This option can be eliminated as well.\n\n(D) Muhammad's revelations of the Qur'an: Although the mi'raj refers to a significant event in Islam, it is not directly related to the revelation of the Quran itself. The Qur'an was revealed to Muhammad through angel Gabriel (Jibril) over a period of 23 years.

It is an essential part of Islamic practice; however, this term, \"The Recitation,\" does not fully encompass the meaning of the Qur'an.\n\n(D) The Pillars - The term \"The Pillars\" do not closely relate to the Qur'an itself.
