Pakistani (attributive adjective) - describes the origin\n6. smoking (attributive adjective) - describes the action that the car can do\n\n(B) circular wonderful smoking Pakistani big orange car\n1. circular - as before, it can be seen as an adjective or describing car's shape, so it's suitable as an adjective here\n2. wonderful (attributive adjective) - describes the kind of car\n3. smoking (attributive adjective) - describes the action that the car does\n4.

However, big and orange (size and color) can both be placed earlier or later in the order without changing the meaning.\n\nIn this case, it seems slightly more intuitive to prioritize describing the attributes like size and color as a more important focal point during the initial mental processing.
