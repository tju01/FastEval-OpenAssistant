Since we are looking for the fifth week of April, this option doesn't fit.\n- Option (E) 04/19/2021: One week before 4/19 is 4/12. Since we are asking for the fifth week of April, which starts from the 4/23, April 16 fits the bill better than 4/19.\n- Option (F) 04/24/2021: One week before 4/24 is 4/17. Since we are looking for the fifth week of April, which starts from the 4/23, April 16 fits the bill better than 4/19.\n\nStep 3: Verify if the resulting date is within the given options:\n- From our calculations, it seems that April 16 is the date we are looking for. As this date falls exactly one week back from yesterday (April 30, 2021).\n\nUnfortunately, none of the given options matches the calculated date.

We need to find the date of the 16th of October, 2009.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the months that have passed since the start.\nJane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month, and it is her 5th visit today. Therefore, we need to calculate the difference between 5 visits and the starting visit, which would be 4 visits that have passed since October.\n\nStep 3: Add the difference in months to the starting date.\nEach visit corresponds to a month that has passed, so we need to add the 4 additional visits to the starting date of October 16th, 2009. Since each month has 30 days, we can simply add 4 months to the starting date:\n\nOctober 16th, 2009 + 4 months = January 16th, 2010\n\nStep 4: Output the answer.\nThe final date today should be the 16th of January, 2010, which is in the format of MM/DD/YYYY as follows:\n\n(F) 01/16/2010",
