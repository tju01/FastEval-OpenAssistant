            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what a Robertsonian translocation is. \n\nStep 1: Understanding Robertsonian translocation\nA Robertsonian translocation is a type of rearrangement of chromosomes in which the long arms (q) of two different acrocentric chromosomes (having a short p arm and a long q arm) are lost. Instead, the remaining short p arms fuse together.\n\nStep 2: Identifying the point of fusion\nAs mentioned in the definition of Robertsonian translocation, the fusion occurs at the p arm (the short arm) of the acrocentric chromosomes. Therefore, we need to identify the option that corresponds to the p arm.\n\nStep 3: Analyzing the options\n(A) Telomeres are protective structures located at the ends of chromosomes, so they are not involved in Robertsonian translocation.\n(B) Centromeres are the part of a chromosome responsible for attaching spindle fibers during cell division, and are not fusion targets in this process.\n(C) Histones are proteins that help to condense and organize chromosomes, so they are not the site of the translocation.\n(D) The ends of long arms have been mentioned as the ones being lost in Robertsonian translocation, not the ones fusing.\n\nNo option directly corresponds to the p arm, which is the site of fusion in Robertsonian translocation. Still, the closest option to the fusion site is (D) ends of the long arms because it refers to the area where fusion occurs. It would be more accurate to say that the fusion occurs between the ends of the short arms that are involved in the translocation, as the long arms are lost from the process.\n\nFinal Answer: (D) ends of the long arms",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the problem\n\nThe problem is asking to find the expected frequency of affected females in a population when the frequency of affected males is already given, 0.10.\n\nStep 2: Determine the relationship between male and female populations\n\nFor an X-linked recessive condition, each individual has two X chromosomes. The first step is to find the frequency of carriers of the affected X chromosome. \nMales: Each male has one X chromosome from the mother (affected or non-affected)\nFemales: Each female has two X chromosomes (one from each parent)\n\nStep 3: Calculate the frequency of carriers\n\nThe given information shows that 10% (0.10) of males are affected. Therefore the frequency at which the affected X chromosome appears among them is 0.1.\n\nFemales could be carrying the affected X chromosome in one of three possible ways:\n\n1. either from mother or father (affected X chromosome from mother or carrier father)\n2. only from carrier father (mother is non-carrier)\n3. from carrier (mother or father)\n\nFrequency calculates as follows:\n\nFrequency of affected daughter = (Frequency of affected son \u00d7 2) \u00d7 (Frequency of carriers of affected X chromosomes \u00d7 P(affected female | any carrier mother or father))\n\nFrequency of carriers of affected X chromosomes = 0.1 (affected son frequency)\n\nUsing the odds ratio for heterozygous female carriers, the given frequencies, and the odds of affected females arising from non-carrier mothers are 0%, we have:\n\nFrequency of affected daughter = (0.10 \u00d7 2) \u00d7 (0.1 \u00d7 P(affected female | carrier father))\nFrequency of affected daughter = 0.2 \u00d7 0.1 \u00d7 P(affected female | carrier father)\n\nLet's assume the mother is a carrier, and the father is non-carrier:\n\nFrequency of affected daughter = (2 \u00d7 2/3) \u00d7 2/4 = 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6\n\nLet's break down the assumptions and steps:\n\n1. (2 \u00d7 2/3) means that the mother could be a carrier with a frequency of 1/3 (all females will carry the affected chromosome in this case, according to Mendelian genetics). Therefore, regardless of the father's condition, the affected daughter frequency will be found in 2/3 of such matings.\n2. (multiplying by 2/4) assumes that the father is non-carrier, which is the compliment of the previous step.\n3. one non-carrier male carries the X chromosome from the mother, which results in 1/6 affected daughters in the population.\n\nAnswer: (B) 0.001\n\nThis implies that if 1% of males are affected by an X-linked recessive condition, then the expected frequency of affected females in the population is 0.001, or about 0.1% of the female population will be affected.",

In DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T) through two hydrogen bonds. This pairing along with the other complementary pairing of guanine (G) with cytosine (C) forms the backbone of the DNA double-helix structure and is crucial for the successful replication and transmission of genetic information.\n\n(D) uracil: Uracil is a pyrimidine base, but it is found in RNA (ribonucleic acid) and not in DNA.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the pattern of inheritance for malignant hyperthermia, we should go through each option step by step:\n\n(A) - Autosomal dominant: For a condition to be autosomal dominant, it means that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed from either parent to have the condition. If malignant hyperthermia was autosomal dominant, affected individuals would pass the condition on to 50% of their offspring, regardless of the offspring's gender. However, malignant hyperthermia is not passed down in this fashion.\n\n(B) - Autosomal recessive: For a condition to be autosomal recessive, it means that an individual needs two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to have the condition. If malignant hyperthermia was autosomal recessive, affected individuals would not pass the condition on to their offspring, unless both parents were carriers. Again, this is not how malignant hyperthermia is passed down.\n\n(C) - X-linked dominant: X-linked dominant conditions are caused by a mutation on the X-chromosome and are dominant, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to have the condition. If malignant hyperthermia was X-linked dominant, affected individuals would pass the condition on to all their daughters but none of their sons. However, this is not how malignant hyperthermia is inherited.\n\n(D) - X-linked recessive: X-linked recessive conditions also arise from a mutation on the X-chromosome. However, in this case, an individual needs two copies of the mutated gene to have the condition. If malignant hyperthermia was X-linked recessive, affected individuals would pass the condition on to all their daughters, who would be carriers, and none of their sons. Half of the carrier daughters would pass the condition on to their sons. Malignant hyperthermia fits this pattern of inheritance because males with the condition tend to pass the gene to all of their daughters (who are carriers), and no sons are affected.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) - X-linked recessive.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what exon skipping is and then identify which type of mutation is associated with it.\n\nExon skipping is a type of RNA splicing event. In gene expression, the primary step after transcription is splicing, wherein the non-coding regions (introns) of a gene are removed, and the coding regions (exons) are joined to form a mature mRNA. This process is carried out by a complex molecular machine called the spliceosome. Exon skipping occurs when the splicing machinery incorrectly joins an upstream exon to a downstream exon, skipping one or more exons in between.\n\nNow, let's analyze each given option:\n\n(A) Nonsense mutations: These are mutations that introduce a stop codon within a gene, leading to the production of a non-functional protein or a truncated protein. They don't directly affect the splicing process, and hence, are not involved in exon skipping.\n\n(B) Regulatory mutations: These mutations affect the function of regulatory genes, which control the expression of other genes. While they can impact gene expression, they are not directly associated with exon skipping. \n\n(C) RNA processing mutations: These mutations affect the various steps in the processing of RNA, including splicing. Exon skipping, as described earlier, is an error in the splicing process. Therefore, it can be associated with RNA processing mutations.\n\n(D) Silent mutations: These are mutations that don't result in a change in the amino acid sequence of the protein, as they are compensated by another mutation in the region. Such mutations do not directly affect the splicing process and hence are not associated with exon skipping.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, we can conclude that exon skipping is associated with:\n\n(C) RNA processing mutations.",
