            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze the given options and compare them with the information provided in the question. The question mentions that the subject is becoming mainstream, has ethical implications, is expensive, and has been used to engage in financial crime. Now, let's examine each option:\n\n(A) Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime - This option states that cryptocurrencies are becoming mainstream, which is consistent with the question. It also mentions that cryptocurrencies are expensive (which may not be entirely true but is often the perception) and secure, but the question specifies that they are associated with financial crime.\n\n(B) Traditional currency, Cheap, Unsecure, Charitable giving - This option is not relevant to the question, as it is discussing traditional currency instead of the main subject, cryptocurrencies.\n\n(C) Cryptocurrencies, Cheap, Secure, Financial crime - This option is not consistent with the question because it states that cryptocurrencies are cheap, which goes against the claim that they are expensive.\n\n(D) Traditional currency, Expensive, Unsecure, Charitable giving - Like option B, this option is not relevant to the question as it discusses traditional currency instead of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBased on the comparison, the best fit for the given question is option (A) Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime.",

Advertising regulatory bodies aim to ensure that adverts do not encourage wrongful actions or create a negative environment.\n\n(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial\nRegulatory bodies wouldn't have ads encourage unsafe practices, so that's correct, but the other choices are less relevant to the aims of advertising regulatory bodies.\n\n(B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious\nUnsafe practices and distress are not good for the intended audience, but fear and serious are not necessarily relevant or beneficial criteria to determine the appropriateness of advertisements.\n\n(C) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial\nPromoting safe practices is a good idea, but wants, jealousy, and trivial don't seem to be strong reasons for regulatory bodies to intervene.\n\n(D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious\nSafe practices align with the aims of regulatory bodies. Distress and jealousy should be avoided in adverts as they create a negative impact, while serious could refer to the degree of the negative effect an ad may create.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n(D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious",

This does not fit the description as it doesn't represent a preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities.\n\n(B) Absenteeism: This term refers to an employee's chronic or frequent absence from work. This term doesn't convey a preferred ratio between work and non-work activities and mostly focuses on the issue of employees being absent from work.\n\n(C) Work-play balance: While this answer choice is closer to describing a preferred balance between work and leisure activities, it doesn't fully address the intensification of work and technological shifts mentioned in the question. \n\n(D) Work-life balance: This term directly refers to an individual's optimal allocation of their time, energy, and attention to achieve a fulfilling experience both professionally and personally. This aligns closely with the question's context of a preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities that have become contested due to changing work and technological conditions.\n\nStep 3: Choose the best-fitting answer: Based on the assessment of each answer choice, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Work-life balance",

It adds value to sustainability thinking due to the consideration of companies and industries being bound together and interdependent because of resources and wastes.\n\nStep 2: Comparing with the options\n\n(A) Industrial supply loops: This term refers to the processes of moving goods from suppliers to customers, but it does not encompass the inter dependency of companies and industries and how they interact with their environments.\n\n(B) Industrial ecosystems: This option seems fitting as it includes the interaction of companies and industries, which are comparable to organisms, with their environment. It considers the flow of resources and wastes between them.\n\n(C) Ecological ecosystems: This term refers to natural environments and their interdependent organisms, but does not specifically address companies and industries.\n\n(D) Corporate ecosystems: It can be interpreted as a system involving companies and industries, but it does not relate explicitly to the environmental aspect mentioned in the description.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best fit for the description given is:\n\n(B) Industrial ecosystems",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's evaluate each choice and select the one that is most fitting for the given context.\n\n(A) Power imbalance, Benefits, Hoodwinked\nIn this option, \"power imbalance\" refers to the unequal distribution of resources, \"benefits\" refer to advantages gained from a relationship, and \"hoodwinked\" refers to being deceived or cheated. While these choices are somewhat relevant to the context of business-CSO collaborations, they do not fit seamlessly.\n\n(B) Power imbalance, Resources, Co-opted\nThe first term, \"power imbalance,\" refers to unequal distribution of resources, while \"resources\" in this context refer to the assets, capacities, and expertise of each participating entity. Lastly, \"co-opted\" refers to an entity that is incorporated into the system and loses its independence, which hints at the risk faced by CSOs in unequal partnerships. This option seems to most closely align with the question's context, and I'll keep it in mind as a possible answer.\n\n(C) Informational asymmetries, Benefits, Hoodwinked\nWhile \"informational asymmetries\" could refer to the differentiated access to knowledge and information between businesses and CSOs, it does not connect as well to the other fits and the provided context. Similarly, the other terms are not closely linked to the key points of the question.\n\n(D) Informational asymmetries, Resources, Co-opted\nThis option is similar to (C), where informational asymmetries are relevant in the context of business-CSO collaborations, but it still not as closely connected as the first term of choice (B). The second term, \"resources,\" could be considered redundant as it has already been mentioned in the question's context. Lastly, \"co-opted\" maintains its relevance to the risk faced by CSOs, but its connection with \"informational asymmetries\" is weak.\n\nBy analyzing each choice step-by-step and comparing their relevancy to the context, I conclude that option (B) Power imbalance, Resources, Co-opted is the most plausible answer.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the normative theory most similar to corporate profit maximization, let's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\nA) Hedonistic Utilitarianism: This theory focuses on maximizing overall pleasure and minimizing overall pain for all individuals affected by an action. It doesn't directly relate to corporate profit maximization as it doesn't care about corporate entities per se.\n\nB) Preference Utilitarianism: This theory is concerned with fulfilling people's preferences, which might cover a range of personal and social desires. This theory doesn't directly concentrate on profit maximization, but it might indirectly be related to employment and overall societal well-being that could come from profitable companies.\n\nC) The Categorical Imperative: This is a deontological theory based on the idea of universal duties towards rational beings. It doesn't focus on maximizing anything like profits, so it is not similar to profit maximization.\n\nD) Ethics of Care: This theory emphasizes interpersonal relationships, compassion, and personal connections, and not focusing on maximizing anything like profits. This theory doesn't directly relate to corporate profit maximization.\n\nAfter comparing each option, while none of them directly prescribe corporate profit maximization, B) Preference Utilitarianism seems to be most similar. It is because it concerns fulfilling people's preferences, which might span a range of personal and societal desires connected to employment and societal well-being that can come from profitable companies.",

            "model_answer": "To determine Milton Friedman's belief on the sole responsibility of business, we need to analyze each option and gather information from his writings and theories.\n\n(A) The only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders:\nIn Milton Friedman's writing \"The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits\" (1970), Friedman argued that the main responsibility of any business is to increase profits for their shareholders, within the limits of the law. When managers act for the benefit of society or other groups, they are taking money from shareholders to whom they have a fiduciary responsibility.\n\n(B) Managers should act in ways that balance the interest of society and shareholders:\nAlthough some managers might choose to balance the interests of shareholders and society, it does not reflect Milton Friedman's main belief. He believed that managers are beholden first and foremost to their shareholders, and acting in any other interest would be a misuse of their authority and fiduciary responsibility.\n\n(C) The primary responsibility organizations have is to its employees:\nAlthough employees are important stakeholders in a business, Milton Friedman focused primarily on the interests of shareholders. He believed that businesses should aim to maximize profits for their shareholders, as it was their responsibility to do so. This does not negate other responsibilities, but the primary one was to the shareholders.\n\n(D) The primary responsibility organizations have is to its stakeholders:\nSince Friedman believed that businesses should focus on increasing profits for their shareholders, acting in a way that advances the interests of multiple stakeholders, as the term 'stakeholders' implies, is not in line with Friedman's ideas about business responsibility.\n\nConsidering Milton Friedman's writings and beliefs, option (A) \"The only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders\" is the one that best represents his views on the sole responsibility of business.
