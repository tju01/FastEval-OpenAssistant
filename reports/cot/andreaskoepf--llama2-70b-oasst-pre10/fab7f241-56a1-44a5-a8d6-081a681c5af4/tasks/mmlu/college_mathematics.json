Find the constraint equation using the fact that the top end is 3 meters above the ground:\nx + y = 3\n\n6. Now, we know the top end slides at the rate of y/2 meters per second, and we know that the bottom end moves at a rate of 2 meters per second. We can use this information to express y as a function of time (t):\ny = 4t\n\n7. Substitute y(t) into step 5 to get the value of x(t):\nx + 4t = 3\nx = 3 - 4t\n\n8.
