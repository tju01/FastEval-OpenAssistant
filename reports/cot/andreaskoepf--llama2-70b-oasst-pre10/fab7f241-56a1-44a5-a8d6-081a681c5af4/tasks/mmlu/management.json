            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze each option to understand its meaning and relevance to the question:\n\n(A) Bargaining: This term refers to the process of discussing and making agreements in detail, however, it does not specifically refer to the outcome of negotiations.\n\n(B) Satisficing: This term, coined by Nobel laureate Herbert Simon, refers to the idea of settling for a outcome that is not optimal, but which meets one's minimum standards. It seems relevant to the question's description of \"sub-optimal but acceptable.\"\n\n(C) Accepting: This term just means responding positively to a situation, offer, or proposal. It does not specifically focus on the outcomes of negotiations and does not necessarily imply sub-optimality.\n\n(D) Compromising: This term refers to the act of making concessions in a negotiation in order to come to an agreement. While it is part of the negotiation process, it does not directly focus on the outcome's characteristics.\n\nAfter reasoning through these options, the answer is clear:\n\n(B) Satisficing",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what each of these terms mean and identify which one fits the description for 'rule of thumb' type of bias in decision making.\n\n(A) Framing Bias: It is the act of manipulating how an individual processes a piece of information or decision to make them see it in a specific way or form, essentially altering the decision's outcome.\n\n(B) Hindsight Bias: It refers to the overestimation of how predictable an outcome was before it actually occurred. In other words, when people believe that they knew the outcome all along, even though the outcome was not easily predictable at the time.\n\n(C) Over-confidence Bias: It occurs when people overestimate the accuracy of their beliefs and judgments, especially when they actually know very little about the subject matter.\n\n(D) Heuristics: These are mental shortcuts or basic rules that people use to simplify complex decision-making processes. They give quick and efficient solutions based on general rules that often work well but can sometimes lead to biased judgments.\n\nNow, let's see which of these terms fits the description of 'rule of thumb' type of bias in decision making.\n\nThe term 'heuristics' matches the description as it involves mental shortcuts or general rules, similar to 'rule of thumb.' These mental shortcuts can save time and effort in making decisions, but they can also lead to biased judgments due to their simplicity.\n\nThus, the answer is (D) Heuristics.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each option and determine which one best represents a normative perspective:\n\n(A) The way things are: This refers to the current state of affairs. It describes what exists now but doesn't imply any judgment on whether it's good or bad. Therefore, it is not a normative perspective.\n\n(B) The way things are going to be: This refers to predictions or expectations about the future, but again, it doesn't involve any evaluations of desirability. Thus, it is not a normative perspective.\n\n(C) The way things should be: This statement involves expressing an opinion or belief about what is considered good, right, or desirable. It values one outcome over another and sets a standard by which we can judge the current state of affairs. This matches the definition of a normative perspective.\n\n(D) The way things were: This refers to past states of affairs, which doesn't involve judging anything as good or bad. It's a description of what happened or existed at a previous point in time. Consequently, it doesn't represent a normative perspective.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is:\n\n(C) The way things should be.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Let's break down each of the available options and their relevance to the \"five forces model\" to identify the answer:\n\n(A) The potential for entry into the industry: This factor, often referred to as \"barriers to entry,\" reflects how easy or difficult it is for new entrants to enter the market. It affects the degree of competition in the industry, but it doesn't describe the type of competitive activity that exists between organisations.\n\n(B) The threat of substitute products: This factor examines how easily customers can switch to alternative products or services if the price or quality becomes undesirable. This factor influences the competition, but it doesn't directly describe the competitive activity between organisations.\n\n(C) The power of customers: This factor refers to the ability of customers to bargain down prices or negotiate better terms with suppliers. While this factor can influence an organization's ability to compete, it doesn't directly describe the type of competitive activity that occurs between organizations.\n\n(D) The level of rivalry: This factor involves the nature of competition currently existing in the industry. It describes the degree of competition based on factors such as the number of competitors, the similarity of products/services, and the industry growth rate, among others.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the type of competitive activity that exists between organisations in the \"five forces model\" is:\n\n(D) The level of rivalry",

            "model_answer": "To determine which political leader could not be termed a 'transformational' leader, we can analyze their impact and the significant changes they brought to their respective countries or the world.\n\n(A) Margaret Thatcher: As the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, she had a significant impact by emphasizing free-market principles and a smaller state as a recovery from Britain's economic turmoil. She played a major role in the end of the Cold War and was nicknamed the \"Iron Lady.\"\n\nConclusion: Margaret Thatcher is considered a 'transformational' leader.\n\n(B) Mikhail Gorbachev: As the leader of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev introduced significant political and economic reforms ( Glasnost and Perestroika) which brought about the collapse of the Soviet Union, the end of the Cold War, and a shift from totalitarianism to democracy in many Eastern European countries. He was one of the Time magazine's \"Men of the Year\" for his role in 1988, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990.\n\nConclusion: Mikhail Gorbachev is also considered a 'transformational' leader.\n\n(C) Nelson Mandela: Nelson Mandela served as the President of South Africa and brought about significant changes in the post-apartheid era. He played a vital role in the dismantling of apartheid through non-violent resistance and reconciliation, leading South Africa to become a democratic and majority-rule country. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, for his work.\n\nConclusion: Nelson Mandela is considered a 'transformational' leader.\n\n(D) Bill Clinton: As the President of the United States, Bill Clinton did introduce some policy changes, but his presidency was overshadowed by personal scandals, such as his impeachment. While he did bring about a sense of stability through economic growth and balanced budgets, his impact on the American political landscape was not as transformative as the other figures mentioned.\n\nConclusion: Bill Clinton could not be termed a 'transformational' leader.\n\nHence, the correct answer is:\n(D) Bill Clinton",

This, however, sounds more like a feature of McGregor's Theory Y, which was developed to contrast Theory X. According to Theory Y, workers are more motivated and successful when management fosters a sense of responsibility and involvement in decision-making.\n\nOption B: \"Workers view physical and mental effort as a natural part of work.\" This option indicates that workers understand the need for hard work and do not consider it a burden. While this may be a general cultural belief, it is not specifically a characteristic of McGregor's Theory X.\n\nOption C: \"Workers like to show initiative.\" This option implies that workers are proactive and enjoy taking the initiative. Once again, this might be an assumption found in Theory Y, not Theory X.\n\nOption D: \"Workers like to be directed.\" This option aligns with McGregor's Theory X, which assumes that workers need and prefer direct supervision and external control. Workers, according to Theory X, lack creativity and are generally unmotivated and not ambitious.\n\nBased on the analysis of the options, the correct answer is (D) Workers like to be directed.",
