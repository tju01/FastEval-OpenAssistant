So, we cannot determine an exact value for $f(1)$. Thus, our answer will be an interval.\n\nStep 2: Obtain a lower bound for $f(1)$ using the convexity.\nSince the function is strictly convex and passes through the points $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$, we know that on the domain between $x = -2$ to $x = 2$, mass points will always be below the line drawn from $(-2, 5)$ to $(2, 9)$ and the curve $y = f(x)$ will above or below the line depending on the curvature of the function.\n\nSo, any $x$ between $x = -2$ and $x = 2$ will satisfy $f(x) \\ge m ((2-(-2)) - (9-5)) = 10 - 4 = 6$.
