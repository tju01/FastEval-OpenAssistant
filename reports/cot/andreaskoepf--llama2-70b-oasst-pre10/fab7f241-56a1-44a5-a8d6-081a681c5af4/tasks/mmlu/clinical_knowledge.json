Smaller gauge sizes (e.g., 22 or 24 gauge) have lower flow rates and resistance.\n\nStep 4: Determine the appropriate balance\nSince a rapid blood transfusion is needed, we will want to prioritize a higher flow rate but still ensure it is manageable.\n\nStep 5: Choose the best option\nAfter reviewing the options and considering the required balance between flow rate and resistance, we can determine that the 18-gauge (option A) cannula is the most appropriate for this situation, as it offers a higher flow rate while still maintaining an acceptable level of resistance.\n\n(A) 18 gauge.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the key attribute in successful marathon running, let's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) Strength: Strength is important for runners, but marathon running primarily requires endurance, which is developed through long-distance training. Additionally, strength training can help prevent injuries, but it's not the most critical factor for success in marathons.\n\n(B) Power: Power refers to the rate at which one can perform work, but marathon running is an endurance event where slow and steady pacing is the key to success. Therefore, power might not be the most important factor in marathon running.\n\n(C) Stride length: A good stride length can aid in efficiency while running, but marathon running primarily focuses on endurance and consistent pacing. Having an efficient stride may reduce the risk of injury and improve overall performance, but it's not the crucial factor for success.\n\n(D) Stamina: Stamina is the ability to sustain prolonged effort over a long time, such as in a marathon. In long-distance running, success depends largely on the ability to maintain a consistent pace and endure the demands of the race. Training and proper pacing can help develop stamina, which is the most important factor in completing a marathon.\n\nBased on the analysis, the key attribute in successful marathon running is:\n\n(D) Stamina.",

            "model_answer": "I will analyze each option one by one to identify which is NOT a symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\n(A) Stridor - Stridor is a high-pitched, inspiratory sound people with difficulty breathing might make during inhalation, and it's often a sign of respiratory distress. Anaphylaxis can affect the respiratory system, making breathing difficult. Stridor indicates anaphylaxis.\n\n(B) Bradycardia - A low heart-rate, less than 60 beats per minute, in adults during rest is classified as bradycardia. Anaphylaxis can result in abnormalities of heart rhythm and even arrest, but in its early symptoms, slower-than-average heart rate is not a notable symptom. For anaphylactic cases, tachycardia (increased heart rate) is more common.\n\n(C) Severe wheeze - Anaphylaxis can lead to trouble breathing due to constriction in the lungs. Wheezing is a whistling or squeaking sound from the lungs when breathing. Therefore, wheezing can be a symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\n(D) Rash - Anaphylactic shock can cause hives or urticaria, which usually appears as a rash that is itchy and red.\n\nFrom the given options, (B) Bradycardia is NOT a common symptom of anaphylaxis, while the other options are.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's examine each option and check whether it corresponds to what happens with an increasing number of sprints:\n\n(A) anaerobic contribution progressively increases.\nDuring sprints, anaerobic respiration becomes more dominant as the body breaks down glucose in the absence of oxygen to generate ATP quickly, increasing the production of laactic acid. Therefore, the anaerobic contribution does increase with increasing sprints.\n\n(B) pH of the muscle falls below 6.0.\nThe accumulation of lactic acid lowers the pH of the muscle during sprints. As the number of sprints increases, the accumulation of lactic acid further increases, causing a decrease in pH.\n\n(C) blood glucose concentration falls below 3 mmol/L.\nSprinting increases the demand for glucose, and the body continuously breaks it down to generate ATP. As such, the blood glucose concentration falls during sprints. However, the decline is likely to slow down as the number of sprints increases, since the rate of decrease would be affected by factors such as gluconeogenesis and glycogen sparing.\n\n(D) relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases.\nAerobic respiration is the primary source of energy during continuous and steady exercise, such as endurance activities. It takes a longer time for the body to shift from anaerobic to aerobic respiration, which leads to an increased reliance on the aerobic system as the duration of exercise increases. Sprints, however, are short bouts of anaerobic exercise, making this statement unlikely to hold true for them.\n\nFrom the analysis of each option, only (A) and (B) hold true with an increasing number of sprints, with the recognition that aerobic metabolism's contribution increases as the duration of exercise increases.\n\nHowever, given that the instructions specifically ask for a single answer as a single letter without the rest of our explanation attached or included in parenthesis, the correct answer is:\n\n(A)",

            "model_answer": "To find the correct answer, I will analyze each option and relate it to the condition of diplopia, which refers to double vision in both eyes.\n\n(A) Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered:\nThis statement is not correct because diplopia can occur even when one eye is covered. This is because diplopia can be due to an issue with one eye, or the muscles and nerves around it, which will still cause double vision when the eye is uncovered.\n\n(B) The outer image is always the false image:\nThis statement is not correct because the false image could be either the outer or the inner image, depending on the cause of the diplopia. Diplopia can happen due to eye misalignment or issues with the ocular muscles, and in such cases, the outer image might not be the false one. However, sometimes it can be, but this statement is too general and therefore incorrect.\n\n(C) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards:\nThis statement is incorrect because fourth nerve palsy, also known as trochlear nerve palsy, is not related to the patient looking upwards. Fourth nerve palsy is a condition where the superior oblique muscle function is compromised, resulting in a misalignment of the eyes, leading to double vision. This condition is not triggered by the patient looking upwards.\n\n(D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint:\nThis statement is true, as a sixth nerve palsy, also known as abducens nerve palsy, affects the lateral rectus muscle, responsible for the outward movement of the eye. When the sixth nerve is impaired, the eye may deviate inward, causing a divergent squint leading to diplopia.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint.",
