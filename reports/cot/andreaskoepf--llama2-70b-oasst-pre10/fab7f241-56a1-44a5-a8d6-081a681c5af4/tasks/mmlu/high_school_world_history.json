By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let us break down both the provided passages step-by-step and analyze the themes of revolution and gender:\n\n1. The first passage, written by Olympe de Gouges, exposes the plea for women's rights during the French Revolution. It highlights the disregard and dissatisfaction many women felt during this period. This made them seek awareness, elevation of their voice, and the bravery to fight back against male-dominated power structures. The passage is clearly centered on the themes of revolution and gender equality.\n\n2. The second passage, interviewed with Halima Ghomri, discusses the disappointment of a poor peasant woman after Algeria's war of independence. She mentions that, though the war is over and they are now free, nothing much has changed for her and her family, including a lack of opportunities for education. This unravels the potential detachment of revolutionary progressivism from gender equality, as the woman's perspective is still overlooked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the various options given:\n\n(A) Revolutionary progressivism does not always concern itself with gender equality: This option seems to align the best with the information provided in the passages. Both Olympe de Gouges and Halima Ghomri highlight the minor or nonexistent concern for women's rights during their respective revolutions.\n\n(B) Women typically assume leadership roles during times of revolution: None of the provided passages support this option. Olympe de Gouges speaks of women's rights being overlooked, and Halima Ghomri shares her disappointment in the lack of change after the revolution.\n\n(C) Women rarely support revolutions and therefore receive little benefit from them: This option is not supported by either of the passages. Olympe de Gouges herself was a voice for women's rights during the French Revolution, and Halima Ghomri's disappointment came from the lack of change after the revolution.\n\n(D) Revolutionary movements are generally uninterested in women's rights: Although both passages express dissatisfaction, it does not definitively say that all revolutionary movements lack interest in women's rights. It just shows certain disappointments during their respective times of revolution.\n\nAfter evaluating the passages and the given options, the answer is:\n\n(A) Revolutionary progressivism does not always concern itself with gender equality.",

British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence.
