            "model_answer": "First, we need to calculate the daily earnings from renting out the limousine. \n\nThe limousine is rented at $245 per hour for 2 hours a day, so:\n\n245 * 2 = $490 daily earnings\n\nNow, we need to subtract the daily costs, which are $50:\n\n490 - 50 = $440\n\nSo, the net daily earnings are $440.\n\nNow we will calculate the annual earnings:\n\nSince the limousine is rented every day of the year, we will multiply the net daily earnings by the number of days per year, which is 365 days per year:\n\n440 * 365 = $161,600\n\nNow, we will calculate the percentage return on investment:\n\nTo calculate the return on investment, we will divide the annual earnings by the cost of the limousine and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n[ (161,600 / 98,000) * 100 ]\n\n[ (1.64) * 100 ] = 164%\n\nThe estimated yearly yield on your investment is 164%.\n\nAnswer: (A) 164%",

Below, we will discuss each option and explain its relationship with the Accounting Standards Codification.\n\n(A) Accounting Standards Updates: \nThese updates represent the primary method by which the FASB maintains the Accounting Standards Codification. They comprise changes, improvements, or clarifications to existing guidance in the Codification. They result from re-examining existing standards and incorporating new findings or interpretations, ensuring high-quality reporting and consistency. Hence, it is these updates that make changes to the Accounting Standards Codification.\n\n(B) Emerging Issues Task Force Releases: \nThe Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) is a separate organization from the FASB, tasked with providing timely guidance on new or emerging financial reporting matters. While EITF issues can have an impact on the accounting standards, they are not directly responsible for changing the Accounting Standards Codification.\n\n(C) Statements of Financial Accounting Standards: \nThese statements were directed at individual financial statements or guiding principles but were replaced by Accounting Standards Updates following the introduction of the Accounting Standards Codification. Since the creation of the Update system, the FASB no longer issues Statements of Financial Accounting Standards.\n\n(D) Staff Technical Bulletins: \nThese were occasional notices issued by the FASB staff, addressing interpretations of existing standards or providing limited guidance that doesn't require an Accounting Standards Update.

            "model_answer": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Dean Co. issued bonds with a due date of July 1 year 12 and incorrectly used the straight-line method to amortize the premium.\n2. We need to find out how using the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method affected the following accounts: Bond carrying amount, Retained earnings.\n\nNow let's analyze each account:\n\n1. Bond carrying amount: The bond carrying amount should be the bond principal plus or minus the bond premium or discount. The straight-line method assumes a constant amortization of premium or discount over the bond's life. However, if we use the effective interest method, it recognizes a higher initial amortization for a bond premium. Hence, using the straight-line method would result in a lower bond carrying amount compared to the effective interest method because amortization would be spread more evenly.\n2. Retained earnings: This account represents the accumulated earnings that are not distributed as dividends but retained. It is affected by amortizing premium, but the error only affects the balance at a given point in time, June 30th year 12. If we understate the bond carrying amount using the straight-line method, we would understate the amortization expense and potentially overstate the retained earnings.\n\nNow we can match our findings to the given options:\n\n(A) Overstated Understated: The bond carrying amount is understated because we are not using the effective interest method, but the retained earnings could be overstated.\n(B) Understated Overstated: The bond carrying amount is overstated (contrary to our finding), and the retained earnings are understated (again, contrary to our finding). \n(C) Overstated No effect: The bond carrying amount is overstated (again contradictory to our findings), but there is no effect on the retained earnings.\n(D) No effect No effect: Neither account is affected (contrary to our findings).\n\nA comparison of our findings against the given options leads us to the correct answer:\n\n(A) Overstated Understated",
