            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nThe following quote is from Voltaire in response to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.\nMy dear sir, nature is very cruel. One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n\u2014Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nThe ideas expressed by Voltaire, above, best illustrate which of the following characteristics of Enlightenment intellectuals?\n\n(A) Many were accomplished scientists, who added important pieces to human understanding of the universe.\n(B) They utilized new methods of communicating their ideas, such as salons and inexpensive printed pamphlets.\n(C) Most rejected religion altogether and adopted atheism as the only credo of a rational man.\n(D) Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze the quote step by step and identify which characteristic of Enlightenment intellectuals it reveals. \n\n1. The quote expresses Voltaire's questioning of why natural disasters occur in \"the best of possible worlds.\" This suggests that he is critical of the notion that everything happens for a reason and that it is divinely ordered.\n\n2. He uses the metaphor of ants in an ant-hill and how their lives are affected by events beyond their control. This could hint at his belief in the randomness of life and the suffering that results from chance occurences, rather than a specific religious or moral explanation.\n\n3. There's mention of families being ruined and fortunes lost, showing an understanding of the economic impacts of disasters and a preference for empathy.\n\n4. Finally, Voltaire criticizes religious institutions like the Inquisition, implying dissatisfaction with religious dogma and a call for some form of tolerance: \"What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing?\"\n\nBased on this analysis, it's clear that the ideas expressed by Voltaire in the quote do not primarily focus on either (A) science, (B) new communication methods, or (C) total rejection of religion. However, they do align with a more critical, tolerant, and objective approach to social and cultural issues, suggesting that the central theme in this quote is a call for tolerance in the face of suffering and random cruelties of the world. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (D) Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.",

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following memoir.\nNot only did he expect all persons of distinction to be in continual attendance at Court, but he was quick to notice the absence of those of inferior degree; at his lever, his couches, his meals, in the gardens of Versailles (the only place where the courtiers in general were allowed to follow him), he used to cast his eyes to right and left; nothing escaped him[;] he saw everybody. If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?\n\n(A) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.\n(B) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.\n(C) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.\n(D) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported King Louis's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, while he removed their power.",

            "model_answer": "In order to determine the best explanation of the bias found in the document, we can analyze each option and see which one aligns most closely with the information provided in the passage.\n\n(A) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.\n\nThis option does not match the passage because the text does not show a sympathetic or supportive view of King Louis. Instead, it consistently describes his controlling nature, manipulation of his court, and his insistence on constant attention and servitude.\n\n(B) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.\n\nAlthough the duke talks about the Bourbons' treatment of the aristocracy and the nobility in a positive light, the passage does not mention any specific suppressive actions taken by the king towards the nobility. Therefore, it is not the best explanation for the observed behavior.\n\n(C) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.\n\nThe passage does not mention the duke's support for these aspects of centralization. Instead, it focuses on King Louis's manipulation of his court and his personal interactions.\n\n(D) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported King Louis's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, while he removed their power.\n\nThe passage offers specific details about Louis XIV's reign, such as his controlling nature and his manipulation of his court, but it doesn't explicitly state the duke's support for those actions. As a consequence, it is not the most suitable explanation.\n\nGiven these evaluations, none of the options align perfectly with the passage in the document. However, option B comes the closest, as it implies that the duke might be critical of King Louis due to his suppression of the nobility. While there is no direct supportive evidence in the passage for this option, the duke's observations about Louis XIV's controlling nature suggest that his views on the king might be unfavorable, leading us to choose the closest option for the answer.",

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\n\n(A) De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\n(B) Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\n(C) Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\n(D) De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.",
