We can do this by factoring the polynomial:\nx^5 + x^3 + 2x + 2 = 0\n(x - 1)(x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) = 0\n\nWe see that there is a singularity at (x - 1) since it divides both terms individually. Since x is a factor, there will be no remainder when dividing x^5 + x^3 + 2x + 2 by (x - 1). Therefore, x^5 + x^3 + 2x + 2 = 0 has a zero at x = 1 in Z_5.\n\nWe can now focus on finding zeros in the integer domain by finding the roots of the shorter part of the polynomial, x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1. \n\nThe first step is to divide both x^5 + x^3 + 2x + 2 = 0 and x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0 by (x - 1) to simplify further.\n\nx^5 + x^3 + x^2 + 2x + 2 = (x - 1)(x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)\nWe know that x = 1 is the root of x^5 + x^3 + x^2 + 2x + 2 and we want to find roots of x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 in the finite field Z_5.\n\nFollowing these steps, we observe that x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 5 in Z_5 which is an irreducibility conditions Factor graph.\nSo the irreducibility test fails, meaning that the polynomial factors in Z_5. We can factor the polynomial as (1 + x + x^2 + x^3) * (x^3 + x^2 + x + 1). We noticed that one of the factors is x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 which has 1 as a root in Z_5. Clearly, x = 1 is the root in Z_5, because x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 equals 1 in Z_5.\n\nSo, we found that there are two zeros in the finite field Z_5: x = 1 and x = 4 (x was already a zero and 4 is the only other possible zero in Z_5).
