O'Sullivan, \"The Great Nation of Futurity,\" discussing American greatness, principles, and the imagined glory of the United States.\n\n2. We need to determine by what means the United States took possession of the Oregon Territory.\n\n3. The available options are:\n\n    (A) The United States was granted the territory in a postwar treaty with France.\n    (B) The United States bought it from the Native Americans who lived there.\n    (C) U.S. settlers were the first to arrive in the region; they claimed it for their country.\n    (D) Great Britain ceded it to the United States as part of a negotiated treaty.\n\n4. We recognize that O'Sullivan's quote does not directly answer our question, but it does provide some context about the time and the optimistic viewpoint of Americans in the 1830s. To answer the question, we must have historical knowledge of the events that took place during the acquisition of the Oregon Territory.\n\n5. From historical events, we know that the Oregon Treaty of 1846 was a negotiated agreement between the United States and Great Britain.\n\n6. This treaty established the border between the United States and British North America (modern-day Canada) at the 49th parallel.\n\n7. The treaty shared the ownership of the Oregon Territory between the United States and Great Britain until the boundary could be established.\n\n8. Understanding the context of the treaty, we can determine that option (D) is the correct answer.\n\nThe answer is: (D) Great Britain ceded it to the United States as part of a negotiated treaty.",
