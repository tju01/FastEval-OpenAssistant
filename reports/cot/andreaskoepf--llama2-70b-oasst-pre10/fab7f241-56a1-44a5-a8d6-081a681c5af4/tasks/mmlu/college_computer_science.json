Managing a large matrix can be cumbersome and error-prone.\n\nB) It is not capable of expressing complex protection requirements:\n- This option is not a difficulty since the access matrix can represent a wide range of access control policies and protection requirements flexibly. Therefore, this option isn't a difficulty that the access matrix approach faces.\n\nC) Deciding whether a process has access to a resource is undecidable:\n- This option is false because a pure access matrix will always have a decision procedure. Since the matrix is fixed, the presence or absence of a rule granting access always exists, and thus decisions are decidable.\n\nD) There is no way to express who has rights to change the access matrix itself:\n- This option is not a difficulty faced by the access matrix approach because the matrix can itself provide permissions for modifying the matrix.

A connected component refers to a subgraph where each node is connected to every other node within that subgraph. The entire graph can be divided into multiple connected components if some pairs of nodes are not connected by edges.\n\n3. The maximum number of connected components (M) would occur if all 10 nodes are paired up using the 6 edges, but since there should be no self-loops, each edge should connect two unique nodes.

The minimum number of connected components (m) refers to the smallest possible subdivision of the entire graph into connected components.
