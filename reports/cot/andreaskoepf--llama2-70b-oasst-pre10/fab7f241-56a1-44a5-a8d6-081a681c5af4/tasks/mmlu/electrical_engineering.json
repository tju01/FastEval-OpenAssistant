For an infinite sheet, the electric field around it is uniform in four opposite directions, and its magnitude is given by the equation: \n\nE meeting 2S\n\nWhere E is the electric field, S is the surface charge density (measured in Coulombs per unit area), and 2 is a proportionality constant (depending on the medium).\n\nNow let's consider two infinite parallel plates being charged.

Given that these two plates are charged with the same charge density, we can determine the electric field between them.\n\nSince the two plates are parallel, the electric fields produced by both plates are in the same direction (parallel), but opposite in magnitude.\n\nIf the magnitude of the electric field produced by one plate is E, then the total electric field between the two plates (when they're charged with the same charge densities) is given by.\n\nTotal Electric Field = Electric Field by Plate 1 - Electric Field by Plate 2\nTotal Electric Field = E - negative E\nTotal Electric Field = 2E\n\nThus, the electric field between the two plates is double the field produced by one plate.

The moving coil resistance is an inherent part of the working mechanism in a dynamometer wattmeter.\n\nStep 4: Determining the effects of each option.\n\n(A) Low resistance would mean a higher amount of current would flow through the circuit, making the torque produced by the coil stronger, and as a result, affecting the power readings of the dynamometer wattmeter.\n\n(B) Very low resistance is the extreme of the low resistance. Therefore, this option results in the same problem but to a higher extent.\n\n(C) High resistance would result in a smaller amount of current flowing through the circuit.
