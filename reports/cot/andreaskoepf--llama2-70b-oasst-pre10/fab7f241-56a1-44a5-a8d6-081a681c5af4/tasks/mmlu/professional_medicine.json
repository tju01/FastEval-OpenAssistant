            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Consider the patient's history, including her recent hospitalization for pulmonary embolism and retroperitoneal hemorrhage, temporary discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy, and IVC filter placement.\n\nStep 2: Review the symptoms she presented during the hospitalization, noting the hematoma's resolution before discharge.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the current symptoms, which include persistent tingling and numbness in the left thigh, a sensation she didn't report during her hospital stay.\n\nStep 4: Review the physical examination findings, including normal vital signs and skin appearance, normal muscle strength, and decreased sensation to light touch over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh.\n\nStep 5: Compare the available options:\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization - This isn't likely, since it isn't linked with the sensation in her left thigh and there is no mention of neurological symptoms.\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement - A filter might potentially cause issues, but there is no direct evidence linking the filter to sensory changes in her left thigh.\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve - This could potentially explain the sensory changes in her left thigh, since it's a nerve-related issue.\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh - Although she had a hematoma during her previous hospitalization, it had resolved before discharge and does not explain her current symptoms or decreased sensation to light touch.\n\nStep 6: Based on the evaluation, the most likely cause of her decreased sensation in the left thigh is (C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, as it directly correlates to the sensory issues she is experiencing.",

The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2 months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years. He has been generally healthy. Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3 years. He takes no medications. He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay. Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?\n\n(A) Atrial fibrillation\n(B) Cor pulmonale\n(C) Systemic hypertension\n(D) Tricuspid valve regurgitation",

The left ventricular hypertrophy and mild cardiomegaly do not necessarily suggest an increased risk for atrial fibrillation.\n\n(B) Cor pulmonale: Cor pulmonale is a right-sided heart failure caused by pulmonary hypertension and increased pulmonary resistance. The given information checks some boxes (cardiomegaly, hypertrophy, and the systolic murmur), but there is no evidence of increased pulmonary resistance or other signs of primary pulmonary disease.\n\n(C) Systemic hypertension: The patient has no current signs of hypertension according to the vital signs but has evidence of LV hypertrophy. Systemic hypertension can be a risk factor for LVH or a consequence of it, but in this case, there are no clear indications of it being a primary concern.\n\n(D) Tricuspid valve regurgitation: This complication might be more likely if there were evidence suggesting right heart dysfunction, instead of the left-sided findings (LV hypertrophy and systolic murmur along the left sternal border). There is no adequate information to support a likely risk for tricuspid valve regurgitation.\n\nBased on the information provided, it is difficult to identify a specific complication that this patient is at greatest risk to. However, it seems from the given options, the patient is less likely to have complications A, B, and D, but more inclined to have a complication related to the established left ventricular condition.

            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand the path of potential lymph node metastasis from a squamous cell carcinoma on the tongue. Tumor cells usually travel from the primary site to regional lymph nodes within the same anatomic region. In the case of tongue cancer, these are the lymph nodes in the neck area, which includes cervical, parotid (or parotid region), retropharyngeal, and submandibular (or submental) nodes.\n\nWe know that there are two risk factors in this particular patient: tobacco use and alcohol consumption. Both of these factors increase the likelihood of there being cancer. The patient has also suffered a significant weight loss, which may also suggest that the cancer has spread.\n\nGiven that the tumor is located at the apex of the tongue, the first appropriate lymph nodes to be checked for evidence of metastasis would be the ones closest to the tumor.\n\n(A) Inferior deep cervical: These lymph nodes are indeed in the neck area, but they are located further down than the other options that might be closer to the tumor location.\n\n(B) Parotid: The parotid region includes the preauricular and the submandibular lymph nodes, which are close to the tumor's location on the tongue. Thus, this is the most appropriate place to start checking the metastasis.\n\n(C) Retropharyngeal: While retropharyngeal lymph nodes are indeed in the neck area, they are not as close as the parotid region to the primary site of the tumor.\n\n(D) Submental: Similarly, the submental lymph nodes are located in the lower part of the neck, farther away from the tumor's location on the tongue.\n\nConsidering all these aspects, the most appropriate site to first evaluate for evidence of metastasis would be \"Parotid\" lymph nodes.",
