When diagnosed early, it is usually effective to treat with antibiotics like ceftriaxone, cefixime, or doxycycline.\n\n(B) has a high risk of infection with a single exposure:\n-Yes, gonorrhea has a high risk of infection with a single exposure as it is a highly contagious infection transmitted through sexual contact.\n\n(C) is asymptomatic (without symptoms) in only a small percentage of those infected:\n-No, this statement is incorrect. Gonorrhea is often asymptomatic in a large percentage of cases, particularly in women. It's estimated that 80% of women and 20-30% of men with gonorrhea have no symptoms.\n\n(D) infections are limited to genital areas:\n-No, this statement is incorrect.

Hence, this option can be ruled out.\n\n(B) evolutionary selection has favored the development of males who respond to novel sexual stimuli: Evolutionary selection may favor the development of males who can respond to diverse stimuli and seek different mating opportunities. This could lead to a higher prevalence of paraphilias in males. This option is a potential answer.\n\n(C) of left brain/right brain differences between the genders: Left brain/right brain differences refer to the dominant sides of the brain that are believed to influence various abilities, cognitive functions, and decision-making. This is not a clear or direct connection to paraphilias in males. This option can be ruled out.\n\n(D) male brains are better developed than are female brains: This statement is too broad and has been largely discredited. It cannot directly be linked to the development or prevalence of paraphilias in males as compared to females.

            "question": "According to a study by Sprecher, Barbee, and Schwartz (1995), women were more likely than men to have ________ following their first act of intercourse.\n\n(A) felt glad\n(B) felt fear\n(C) experienced guilt\n(D) experienced regret",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question step-by-step, first we need to understand the information given:\n\n1. We have a study conducted by Sprecher, Barbee, and Schwartz in 1995.\n2. The study is focused on women's emotions following their first act of intercourse.\n3. We have four potential emotions for the blank in the question: (A) felt glad, (B) felt fear, (C) experienced guilt, and (D) experienced regret.\n\nNow we will go through each of the potential emotions and check if they match the study findings.\n\n(A) Felt glad - This emotion is possible, as women could feel glad after their first act of intercourse if the experience was enjoyable and fulfilling.\n\n(B) Felt fear - Although women might feel fear before their first act of intercourse, it is less likely that they would feel more fear than men after the act.\n\n(C) Experienced guilt - Guilt may be a possibility if women felt they broke societal or personal boundaries by engaging in intercourse.\n\n(D) Experienced regret - Similar to guilt, regret could be a possibility if women reflected negatively on their experience following the act.\n\nNow we need to choose the most appropriate answer by comparing the probabilities of each emotion:\n\n- Felt glad, experienced guilt, and experienced regret are all emotions related to evaluating the situation after the act.\n- Felt fear is a different category of emotion that deals with fear before the act.\n\nFrom the remaining emotions, we should choose the one with the highest likelihood given the information in the question. In this case, the answer is:\n\n(C) experienced guilt \n\nReasoning: Women may be more likely to experience guilt as it relates to societal and personal expectations surrounding their first act of intercourse, as opposed to a fear that would be more applicable before the act. Regret and gladness are somewhat less focused options for the study, and extra information might be needed to choose between these two options.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer the question, we will go through each option step-by-step and analyze if cocaine abuse during pregnancy is related to each of them:\n\nA) An increased risk of low birth weight babies: Cocaine abuse during pregnancy is known to cause problems with fetal growth, including reduced fetal weight. Additionally, using cocaine can lead to complications like preterm labor, which may also contribute to low birth weight babies. So, option A is related to cocaine abuse during pregnancy.\n\nB) Poorer growth and lower intelligence: Cocaine exposure in the womb can affect the developing brain and nervous system of the unborn child. As a result, neurodevelopment may be impaired, potentially leading to issues with growth, cognitive development, and intelligence. So, option B is related to cocaine abuse during pregnancy.\n\nC) Smaller head circumference: Cocaine abuse during pregnancy has been linked to microcephaly, a condition characterized by smaller head circumference and impaired brain development. This may significantly impact the child's cognitive abilities, learning, and motor skills. So, option C is related to cocaine abuse during pregnancy.\n\nSince all the options have been established to have a relation with cocaine abuse during pregnancy, we can conclude with the answer:\n\n(D) all of the above",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer the question, let's first look at the characteristics of each type of lover according to attachment theory.\n\n(A) Secure lovers are comfortable with close relationships and trust their partners. They are not easily jealous, and they communicate effectively.\n\n(B) Avoidant lovers often avoid close relationships, fear intimacy, and find it difficult to express emotions openly.\n\n(C) Anxious-ambivalent lovers fiercely crave intimacy, but at the same time are conflicted about it. They often feel a sense of insecurity, and their behavior can seem desperate, they may become excessively possessive or jealous and they often try to maintain control.\n\n(D) Passionate lovers are known for their deep emotional intensity, quick relationships formation, and frequently change their feelings.\n\nNow let's examine Joe's situation with Helen and analyze his behavior based on the descriptions above.\n\nJoe wants to get close to Helen, which might suggest he desires intimacy. However, Helen appears to be put off by his desperate advances. Typically, secure and passionate lovers don't make others feel put off or uncomfortable. This scenario is heavily leaning towards the characteristics of avoidant and anxious-ambivalent lovers.\n\nThe fact that Joe's relationships with women are always typical of his behavior with Helen, suggests he feels some level of insecurity. He creates an environment that makes others feel uneasy, which characterizes anxious-ambivalent lovers. Therefore, based on this analysis, Joe would best be described as:\n\n(C) an anxious-ambivalent lover",
