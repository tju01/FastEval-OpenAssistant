            "model_answer": "We can first examine each of the available options to evaluate them.\n\n(A) 4t = 112; $448\nTo find the cost of one ticket, we should isolate the variable \"t\" on a side of the equation. We can do that by dividing both sides of the equation by 4. \n4t / 4 = 112 / 4\nThe '4's on the left side cancel out, leaving:\nt = 28\nAccording to this equation, each ticket would cost $28 (since the total cost is $112 divided by 4). So, this option is incorrect because it states the total cost for four tickets is $448 which is not true.\n\n(B) 4t = 112; $28\nFollowing the same logic as option (A), we can also divide both sides of this equation by 4. \n4t / 4 = 112 / 4\nt = 28\nThis option correctly calculates the cost of one ticket, as $28 is the correct price based on the given information.\n\n(C) t over 4 = 112; $448\nHere, we attempt to isolate the variable \"t\" by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4. However, we encounter a contradiction, as dividing the given cost by 4 yielded $28, and multiplying the cost by 4 should result in 112. This equation implies that the cost of four tickets is $448, which is incorrect.\n\n(D) t over 4 = 112; $28\nThis equation seems to confuse the actuator into thinking that t is the total cost (possibly intending to indicate this as a fraction instead). We performed the opposite operation of dividing by 4 to correctly isolate t and found that t = 28, just as in options A and B. This leaves out the cost of one ticket and doesn't result in a complete sentence.\n\nBased on the step-by-step reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) 4t = 112; $28",
