            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to look into the history of marketing and identify the period when the production era ended. The major shifts in marketing history are related to the industrial revolution, mass production, and the rise of consumer culture.\n\n(A) In the late 1800s: The late 1800s marked the beginning of the industrial revolution, which led to a massive increase in production. Mass production began to replace traditional craft production, allowing products to be made quickly and cheaply. This change increased the supply of products and made them more available to the general public. However, the production period did not end in the late 1800s.\n\n(B) In the early 1900s: By the early 1900s, mass production was in full swing in many industries, particularly in the United States. Factories churned out large quantities of goods, and the focus of marketing still revolved around producing and distributing these goods. However, the production period did not end in the early 1900s either.\n\n(C) In the 1920s: The 1920s saw the rise of consumer culture, fueled by increased wages, reduced working hours, and a shift in social values. People began to consume more goods and services, and companies started to focus shift their focus from production to selling their products. The production period was certainly evolving during this time, but it did not end in the 1920s.\n\n(D) After the end of the Second World War: Post-WWII was marked by massive economic growth and consumer demand. The increase in advertising and marketing techniques, such as television advertising and the rise of the sales promotion industry, led to an even greater focus on selling and meeting consumer desires. Many historians argue that the production era ended with the shift to a more market-oriented focus.\n\nThus, the production period in the history of marketing is generally considered to have ended after the Second World War (Option D). The final output is:\n\n(D) After the end of the Second World War",

            "question": "The extent to which a service envelops a product varies according to a number of factors.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which factor is NOT related to the extent to which a service envelops a product, we can analyze each factor separately:\n\n(A) The level of tangibility associated with the type of product: Services tend to be less tangible than products, and the relationship between a product and its associated service becomes more blurred as the product becomes less tangible. Therefore, this factor may influence the extent to which a service envelops a product.\n\n(B) Performance-value: Performance-value seems unrelated to the relationship between a product and its associated service. This factor primarily deals with the worth of the service or product, rather than the link between them. So, this factor does not influence the extent to which a service envelops a product.\n\n(C) Variations in supply and demand: Supply and demand can impact the availability and value of products and services. When demand for a product is high, the associated service can envelop the product to a greater extent to meet consumer needs. This factor is likely to influence the extent to which a service envelops a product.\n\n(D) The way in which the service is delivered: This factor directly relates to how the service is coupled with the product. The way in which a service is provided can impact the extent to which it envelops the product. For example, if the service is delivered as part of the product package, it is more enveloping than if it is a separately provided resource.\n\nBased on this analysis, the factor that is NOT related to the extent to which a service envelops a product is:\n\n(B) Performance-value",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step:\n\nOption A: The Sherman Antitrust Act is a federal law that prohibits certain business practices, such as price fixing and market division, which restricts fair competition. Since the gasoline station owners are secretly agreeing to keep their prices high, they are engaging in price fixing, which is a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. If found guilty, they could face prison time.\n\nOption B: The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act is a federal law that governs warranties on consumer products, and it does not apply to the pricing practices of retailers. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption C: The Adamson Act is a state law in California that regulates certain conditions of employment, such as work hours and wages. It is not related to the pricing practices of retailers, so this option is incorrect as well.\n\nOption D: While it is true that retailers have the right to set their own price levels, it is not a valid defense if they engage in price fixing, which is a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, as stated above.\n\nSo, based on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) found guilty under the Sherman Antitrust Act and face prison time",
