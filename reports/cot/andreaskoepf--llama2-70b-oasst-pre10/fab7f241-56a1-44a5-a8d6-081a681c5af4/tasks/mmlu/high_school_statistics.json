An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim. Which of the following gives the P-value of this test?\n\n(A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(B) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(C) P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n(D) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7",

To do this, divide the sample mean by the standard error: 300.6 / 1.8 \u2248 167.\n\nStep 4: Determine the P-value. With df = 6 and t = 1.54, the value 167 is unlikely.

We know that our waiting time normal distribution (X) has a mean of 35 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes. Therefore, we have:\n\nZ = (X - 35) / 10\n\nStep 2: We can phrase the problem in terms of the probability between the interval boundaries. The probability density function (PDF) of Z is given by the standard normal distribution equation:\n\nPDF(Z) = (1 / sqrt(2*pi)) * e^(-0.5 * Z^2)\n\nStep 3: Calculate the probability that there are between 1 and 100,000 riders in the various time intervals.\nSince our normal distribution has a standard deviation of 1, we only need to calculate the cumulative probability for 100,000 riders and 0 riders.\n\n(A) Probability between 0-31.7 minutes:\nCumulative probability (Z < -1.323) = 0.09145\n\n(B) Probability between 31.7-39.3 minutes:\nCumulative probability (Z > 1.323 and Z < 0.577) = 0.83964\n\n(C) Probability between 25.3-44.7 minutes:\nCumulative probability (Z > 0.662 and Z < 0.007) = 0.72731\n\n(D) Probability between 25.3-35 minutes:\nCumulative probability (Z > 0.662 and Z < -0.035) = 0.06115\n\nStep 4: Select the shortest time interval with the highest probability of containing 100,000 riders.\nWe can see that option (D) has the shortest time interval and the highest probability among options A, B, and C.\n\nAnswer: (D) 25.3 to 35 minutes",

For example, a random variable could have possible outcomes of \"fluorescent\", \"incandescent\", and \"LED\" for types of light bulbs.\n\n(B) The possible outcomes must be mutually exclusive.\nThis statement is true because for a discrete random variable, outcomes cannot simultaneously occur or overlap each other.\n\n(C) The mean (expected value) always equals the sum of the products obtained by multiplying each value by its corresponding probability.\nThis statement is true. The mean of a random variable is an integral part of the probability distribution, and is calculated by taking each possible outcome and multiplying it by its corresponding probability, then adding all of these products together.\n\n(D) Approximately 95% of the outcomes will be within two standard deviations of the mean.\nThis statement is not always true for discrete random variables. This probability distribution-pattern specifically applies to normal (Gaussian) distributions in which the mean, median, and mode are equal, and about 95% of the observations lie within two standard deviations of the mean. This is not necessarily the case for all discrete random variables, particularly when the distribution is strongly skewed or leptokurtic.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the question can be rephrased as:\n\nWhich of the following statements is not always true for all discrete random variables?\n\nAnswer: (D) Approximately 95% of the outcomes will be within two standard deviations of the mean.",

Therefore, statement (A) is false.\n\n(B) Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered.\nThis statement is false because whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is not decided after the data are collected; the choice is generally decided before data collection based on the research hypotheses.\n\n(C) If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.\nIf a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, the alpha level indicates a 1% probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (taking into account type I and type II errors).
