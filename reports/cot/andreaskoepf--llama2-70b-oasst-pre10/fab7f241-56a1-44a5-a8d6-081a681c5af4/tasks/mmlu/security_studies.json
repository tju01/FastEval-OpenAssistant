            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine which of these principles is not an element of the responsibility to protect, let's analyze each one.\n\n(A) The responsibility to prevent.\n- This principle refers to the prevention of mass atrocities or human rights violations. It is Tier 1 of the responsibility to protect, which involves actions such as early warning, diplomatic responses, and other peaceful means to prevent potential harm or conflict. Thus, it is an element of the responsibility to protect.\n\n(B) The responsibility to react.\n- This principle refers to the need for the international community to respond to ongoing mass atrocities or human rights violations, usually brought to attention by Tier 1 prevention mechanisms. It is Tier 2 of the responsibility to protect and could involve measures such as economic sanctions or diplomatic pressure. Therefore, this is also an element of the responsibility to protect.\n\n(C) The responsibility to remain sovereign.\n- This principle refers to a state's obligation to maintain its territorial integrity and authority above external interference. It is generally seen as a core principle of international law and state sovereignty. Since the responsibility to protect implies intervention in domestic affairs when a state fails to protect its citizens, this principle isn't part of the responsibility to protect but rather a separate concept. Hence, it is not an element of the responsibility to protect.\n\n(D) The responsibility to rebuild.\n- This principle refers to the accountability of a government to provide assistance and support to communities affected by mass atrocities or human rights violations. Typically, this requires a well-coordinated approach, including the facilitation of humanitarian assistance, reconstruction of damaged infrastructure, and the restoration of internal stability. It is considered Tier 3 of the responsibility to protect, so it is an element of the responsibility to protect.\n\nIn conclusion, (C) The responsibility to remain sovereign is not an element of the responsibility to protect. Hence, the answer is:\n(C)",

            "question": "Can environmental changes be reconciled with national security interests?\n\n(A) Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, leads to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs.\n(B) Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal.

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n\nThis option suggests that government responses have involved viewing organized crime as a national security threat, with information sharing approaches being mostly bilateral in nature. \n\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n\nIn this option, the focus is on harmonizing legislation and increasing police capacity. The objective is to target those committing the crimes instead of the criminal markets.\n\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n\nThis option highlights the influence of the US war on drugs on the governmental response, emphasizing bilateral/multilateral cooperation and inducing states to increase regulation and enforcement against transnational organized crime (TNC).\n\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.\n\nThis option focuses on the emergence of norms governing the response to organized crime and the militarization of law enforcement in connection with the Global War on Terror.\n\nFrom the given information, it seems that the primary focus of governments' responses to the threat of TNC post-Cold War has been national security, legislative harmonization, police capacity, international cooperation (bilateral and multilateral), and addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade.

These policy prescriptions cover various aspects of economic liberalization, such as fiscal discipline, monetary policy, trade liberalization, and privatization.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the options:\n\n(A) Fiscal Discipline: It is one of the key components of the Washington Consensus. Thus, it matches the description of a step of the Washington Consensus.\n\n(B) Tax Reform: Implementing tax reforms is also one of the key elements of the Washington Consensus. Therefore, tax reform falls under the policy prescriptions promoted in the Washington Consensus.\n\n(C) Property Rights: Property rights are indeed part of the Washington Consensus, as securing their protection is essential to ensure successful economic policy. Thus, this option is also within the Washington Consensus definition.\n\n(D) Nationalization: State enterprises should be protected.
