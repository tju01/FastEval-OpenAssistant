Statement B states that the arrogance of our consciousness blocks the unconscious complexes, and it is one of the strongest defense mechanisms. Statement C connects these two concepts by explaining that due to the blocking of unconscious complexes by the arrogance of our consciousness, it becomes difficult to convince people about the unconscious and teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion (D) It is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts. This statement summarizes the reasoning presented in Statements A, B, and C by focusing on the difficulties in convincing people about the unconscious aspects and teaching them information that goes against their conscious knowledge.",
