Research for reliable statistics on this topic from a reputable source.\n3. Compare the obtained information with the available options (A, B, C, D).\n4. Choose the option that is closest to the researched information.\n\nStep 1: I identified the required information as overweight percentages for adults aged 18 years or older in 2016.\n\nStep 2: I will perform a quick research using reputable sources. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2016, approximately 45-50% of the world's adult population was overweight.\n\nStep 3: Comparing the obtained information to the available options:\n- (A) 10%: This is significantly lower than the researched value.\n- (B) 20%: This is closer than option (A) but still much lower than the researched value.\n- (C) 40%: This is closer still, but it is still somewhat lower than the researched value.\n- (D) 80%: This is not a reasonable estimate based on the researched data.\n\nStep 4: Choose the option closest to the researched information. Although none of the options are perfect matches, the closest option is (C) 40%.\n\nFinal answer: C",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Determine the GDP per capita in the United States in 1850.\nAccording to historical records, the GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 was approximately $541.\n\nStep 2: Adjust for inflation.\nTo begin adjusting for inflation, we need to find the CPI (Consumer Price Index) ratio between 1850 and 2011. Comparing the CPI prices in the two years, we find a ratio of approximately 0.0348.\nSo the adjusted GDP per capita is ($541 * 0.0348) = $18.61.\n\nStep 3: Account for PPP (Purchasing Power Parity).\nWe are given the adjusted GDP per capita in 2011 prices, which already incorporates PPP adjustments. We will thus use this value: $18.61.\n\nAnswer:\nTherefore the GDP per capita in the United States in 1850, adjusted for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices, is approximately $18.61. The closest match from the given options is (C) About $8k, as the GDP per capita after adjusting is not a whole number but the closest option to it is about $8k.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine the increase in GDP per capita in Japan from 1950 to 2016, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the GDP per capita in 1950 and 2016.\n2. Control for inflation.\n3. PPP-adjust the values.\n4. Calculate the increase between the adjusted values and express it as a multiple of the 1950 value.\n\nStep 1: Find the GDP per capita in 1950 and 2016:\n\nIn 1950, Japan's GDP per capita was approximately $2,386. By 2016, it increased to about $44,111.\n\nStep 2: Control for inflation.\n\nSince we're comparing values from different years, we need to consider inflation. Although economists argue about specifics, for simplicity, we'll consider an average inflation rate of 2% per annum that would accumulate over 66 years to 668%. We will divide the 2016 GDP per capita by 668% to account for the compounding effect of inflation over this period of time. $44,111/668% = $66.\n\nStep 3: PPP-adjust the values.\n\nWe will use purchasing power parity (PPP) to account for the change in value of a currency in different countries. Since we are comparing Japan against itself over time, the PPP adjustment should equal 1. So the adjusted GDP per capita in 2016 is $66.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the increase between the adjusted values.\n\nNow that we have the adjusted GDP per capita values for both 1950 and 2016, let's calculate the increase: $66 (2016) - $2,386 (1950) = $63,386. Divide this increase by the original 1950 GDP per capita $2,386 to get a multiple: $63,386 / $2,386 \u2248 26.6 fold.\n\nThe answer is (C) by 15 fold.",
