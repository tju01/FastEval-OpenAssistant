            "correct_answer": "(A)",
            "model_answer": "First, let's identify the time periods where Susan was observed doing activities. Based on the information provided, Susan could have gone to the coffee shop during breaks between those activities or during the period when she listened to everyone else.\n\nHere's a breakdown of when Susan was seen doing activities:\n\n1. Linda saw Susan from 7am to 11am\n2. John saw Susan from 11am to 12pm\n3. Jessica saw Susan from 12pm to 1pm\n4. Steven saw Susan from 1pm to 2pm\n5. Thomas saw Susan from 2pm to 6pm\n\nSusans activities duration view by others \n\nLet's consider the periods when Susan was not occupied with activities. From 7am to 11am, she was occupied by Linda. So, starting from 11:01 am, Susan had a break until she went to buy clothes from 11am to 12pm when she was seen by John.\n\nShe had another break after 12 pm to 12:59 pm before she was seen taking photos by Jessica from 12:00 pm to 1 pm.\n\nShe had another break following this at 1:01 pm to 1:59 pm when she returned to be seen again for an activity From 2 pm to 6 pm, Thomas saw Susan reading at the library. This means she had another break from 6:01 pm to 8:59 pm until the coffee shop closed. \n\nHence, out of the given options, from 6pm to 9pm is when Susan was not seen doing any activity by anyone. \n\nSo, Susan could possibly have gone to the coffee shop between 6pm to 9pm.\nThus, the correct answer is:\n(A) 6pm to 9pm",

            "model_answer": "To determine when Andrew could have gone to the art studio, let's examine the given time frames:\n\n1. 8am to 10am: During this time, Richard saw Andrew buying a phone at the electronics store. This means the one-hour overlap from 8am to 9am is the only part of this time frame where Andrew could potentially go to the art studio. However, there's no confirmed information about it so this is uncertain.\n\n2. 2pm to 3pm: During this time, Samantha saw Andrew fixing their computer at the electronic store. The art studio was closed after 6pm; it overlaps with this time frame, making it a likely time for him to visit the art studio.\n\n3. 4pm to 6pm: During this time, Sarah saw Andrew buying lunch at the deli. After 6pm, the art studio was closed and this time frame is unavailable to visit the art studio.\n\n4. 3pm to 4pm: During this time, Michael saw Andrew reading at the library. The time frame is between 3pm and 4pm, when the art studio was still open, making it a potential time for him to visit the art studio.\n\nBased on the analysis of the given time frames, there are two options where Andrew could have likely gone to the art studio:\n\n(B) 2pm to 3pm\n(D) 3pm to 4pm",

            "model_answer": "Let's go through the events step by step:\n\n1. Sean woke up at 5 AM.\n2. James saw Sean at the theater from 5 AM to 6 AM.\n3. David saw Sean at the bakery from 6 AM to 7 AM.\n4. Sarah saw Sean working out at the gym from 7 AM to 9 AM.\n5. William saw Sean attending class at school from 11 AM to 2 PM.\n6. Richard saw Sean taking photos at the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 2 PM to 4 PM.\n7. The basketball court was closed after 4 PM.\n\nNow, let's consider the time windows between events where Sean could have gone to the basketball court:\n- Between waking up and the movie (5 AM to 5 AM)\n- Between the movie and the bakery (6 AM to 6 AM)\n- Between the bakery and the gym (7 AM to 7 AM)\n- Between the gym and attending class (10 AM to 10 AM)\n- Between attending class and taking photos (1 PM to 1 PM)\n\nWe can see that there are no other spans of time mentioned between the events, so we need to find which option, if any, matches one of these time gaps.\n\nComparing these time gaps to the options:\n- (A) 9 AM to 11 AM doesn't match any of the identified gaps.\n- (B) 2 PM to 4 PM doesn't match any of the identified gaps and acknowledges that the basketball court was closed which isn't relevant to the time search needed.\n- (C) 6 AM to 7 AM matches one of the identified gaps (6 AM to 6 AM) but is not suitable due to the fact that Sean was at the bakery during this time.\n- (D) 11 AM to 2 PM matches one of the identified gaps (11 AM to 10 AM) and does not clash with any other activity Sean was engaged in.\n\nBased on the information provided:\n- The basketball court was closed after 4 PM.\n- The only available time for Sean to go to the basketball court would be early in the day in order not to clash with other commitments.\n\nTherefore, the most suitable answer is:\n(D) 11 AM to 2 PM",

The bakery was closed after 9pm.\n\nNext, let's analyze the given timeline:\n- Samantha couldn't have gone to the bakery between 5am to 6am, because she was at the electronics store at that time.\n- Similarly, Samantha couldn't have gone to the bakery between 6am to 12pm, as she was at the airport during that period.\n- Then, she was at the mall until 2pm, so she couldn't have gone to the bakery during the same time.\n- She was on a rooftop from 2pm to 3pm, so she couldn't have gone to the bakery at that time as well.\n- Finally, the bakery was closed after 9pm, so Samantha couldn't have gone there after 9pm.\n\nNow, we analyze the given options:\n(A) 6am to 12pm -> Samantha was at the airport\n(B) 2pm to 3pm -> Samantha was on a rooftop\n(C) 5am to 6am -> Samantha was at the electronics store\n(D) 3pm to 9pm -> Samantha couldn't have gone to the bakery between these hours as the bakery was closed after 9pm\n\nNone of the given options are correct, since Samantha couldn't have gone to the bakery between any of the options provided.
