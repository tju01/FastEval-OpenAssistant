It's a positive assessment of the person and their actions. \n\n(B) \"He's a terrible person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need\"\nThis statement also refers to the same person, but it sarcastically gives an opposite assessment of them as doing something terrible. The fact that someone is promoting a charity stream to help children in need is a morally positive action. Labeling this as \"terrible\" is ironic since it actually has a positive impact.\n\nConsidering these statements, we can see that (B) is sarcastic, as it contains an ironic or exagerated assessment of the person's actions that are indeed positive in nature, thus contradicting the intent behind the statement.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

It does not contain an element of mockery or sarcasm, so it is not sarcastic.\n\n(B) Hey just be happy that you won't be depressed anymore\nThis statement seems to be suggesting that the person should be grateful for no longer being depressed, implying a negative situation has been resolved. However, it is said in a way that carries no genuine empathy or understanding, which makes it sarcastic.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the statement (B) Hey just be happy that you won't be depressed anymore is sarcastic.

The usage of the word \"okay\" seems to suggest that casual racism is tolerable, which is clearly not true, and hence the statement can be interpreted as sarcastic. \n\nStatement B: \"Just memeing about being racist, that's what keeps it toxic.\" \nThis statement does seem to express a genuine sentiment. It states that sharing racist memes only makes the situation worse or more toxic than it already is. There is no irony or sarcasm present in this statement as it presents a serious issue and does not attempt to make light of it while suggesting it is done for ironic reasons.\n\nBased on the analysis, the sarcastic statement is (A), as it uses irony and implies that spreading racist memes is considered acceptable while making it appear more acceptable than it truly is.",

It mirrors a concerned, possibly genuine tone about seeking justice and intervening in such situations.\n\n(B) \"You are right when you say that he should have just let them get away for assaulting him\":\nThis statement implies the speaker agrees with the idea that a person should allow their assailants to get away without any consequence, which is opposite to the implied norm of seeking justice and taking action against attackers.

It is claiming that the two actions are completely different and distinguished based on the given words \"totally different.\" However, both threatening and urging might have some similarities in essence, in that they can both involve influencing someone's behavior, albeit in different ways. It seems like there is an intent to emphasize the distinction between them with a hint of sarcasm.\n\nStatement (B): \"He didn't threaten, he only pleaded; totally different.\"\n- This statement compares a threat to pleading someone. Pleading is different from threatening in the sense that pleading is usually non-aggressive and appeals to someone's emotions or feelings, while threatening involves the use of intimidation or coercion. There is clearly a difference between the two actions, but the phrase \"totally different\" might be used sarcastically since some nuances of influencing behavior could be shared.\n\nBased on the analysis, both statements have a sense of sarcasm due to the usage of \"totally different\". However, in statement (A) the sarcasm is more noticeable because the comparison is between threatening and urging which have more similarities in nature. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(A)",

It implies that living a more affluent lifestyle would solve all the problems or difficulties of those facing financial hardship. In reality, this is not true, as being poor is typically a result of systemic issues and circumstances beyond an individual's control. Therefore, this statement can be considered sarcastic because it mocks the assumption that poverty is easy to overcome.\n\n(B) \"Have you tried not being rude? It is much easier\"\n\nThis statement is less critical and less sarcastic, as it seems to offer advice on a personal behavior that can be controlled. It implies that the person might be more successful in their relationships or interactions if they refrain from being rude. This statement could be taken seriously, or it could be seen as a lighthearted comment depending on the context of the conversation.\n\nComparing the two options based on the analysis above, the sarcastic statement in this case is:\n\n(A) Have you tried not being poor?

Given this, the statement appears to be sarcastic, as it proposes a solution that doesn't represent progress.\n\n(B) Yeah. Let's get rid of the trams and build lightrail instead\nThe statement suggests replacing trams with lightrail. Lightrail is a modern, efficient mode of transportation in many cities, and replacing trams with lightrail is plausible and makes sense in the context of improving urban transportation.

However, using the phrase \"isn't unfamiliar\" makes the statement a bit more complicated than necessary. It could potentially imply sarcasm depending on the tone and context in which it's being used. But without that information, we cannot definitively say this statement is sarcastic.\n\n(B) You mean Knuth up arrow notation isn't normal for you?\n\nThis statement seems to suggest that the speaker assumes or was led to believe that the listener should find Knuth up arrow notation normal. However, the phrase \"isn't normal\" contradicts this assumption, implying that the listener doesn't find it normal, and the speaker is expressing surprise about it. This suggests that the statement is sarcastic, as it pushes the idea that the listener should have found the notation normal.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the analysis above, the statement that is sarcastic is:\n(B) You mean Knuth up arrow notation isn't normal for you?",

It will definitely get warmer in a couple weeks for our first playoff game.\nOption B: You're right, it's the last week of winter! It will definitely get warmer in a couple weeks for our first playoff game.\n\nAt this point, if we consider the general seasonal pattern, we know that winter is generally colder and doesn't get warmer during the season. Hence, a statement mentioning that it will definitely get warmer during winter raises initial suspicion that it may be sarcastic.\n\nConsidering both options:\n\nOption A suggests that it is the first week of winter, which is a time when temperatures are generally expected to be cold. The statement that the weather will get \"definitely warmer\" in a couple of weeks implies a pattern of weather opposite to the common trend. This indeed can be considered sarcastic.\n\nOption B suggests that it is the last week of winter, and not the first week of winter as implied in option A. However, it still claims that the weather will \"definitely get warmer\" in a couple of weeks. The statement is potentially ambiguous; it could imply that the statement is sarcastic because winter temperatures are not expected to get warmer, or it could be genuine belief, as the end of winter may be replaced by spring which is a warmer season.\n\nGiven these interpretations, the more likely choice for a sarcastic statement is Option A.\n\nFinal line: (A)",

There is no underlying negative connotation in this statement, as it simply highlights appreciation for the relatively stable prices during this long-term period.\n\nStatement (B):\n\"Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight days ago\"\nThis statement implies that the speaker is expressing gratitude because prices haven't increased within a short timespan of just eight days. By using a short timespan, the speaker implies that they expect prices to increase regularly and energetically. The underlying negative connotation here implies a certain level of dissatisfaction with the price changes, and could be interpreted as sarcasm.\n\nMoreover, in colloquial English, sarcasm is often used to express disapproval or disappointment, either by being overly critical, or highlighting something seemingly absurd or naive. In this context, the irony in statement (B) implies that the speaker is not genuinely appreciative or relieved, as they seem to imply that it's illogical to expect stability in prices over a short period of time. \n\nBased on this analysis, statement (B) should be the sarcastic one.\n\nThe answer is (B).",
