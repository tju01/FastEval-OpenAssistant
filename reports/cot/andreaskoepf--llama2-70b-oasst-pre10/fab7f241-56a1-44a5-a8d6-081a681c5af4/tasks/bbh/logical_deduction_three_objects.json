Mya finished below Ada.\n3. Mel finished above Ada.\n\nFrom the information, we can attempt to arrange the golfers based on their standings in the tournament.\n\nConsidering statement 2 (\"Mya finished below Ada\"), we understand that Mya performed worse than Ada in the sense of their places in the competition.\n\nNow, taking into account that Mel (\"Mel finished above Ada\") had a better performance than Ada, as it is stated that they finished above her, we can deduce the final order.\n\nBased on this analysis, the standings are:\n\n1. Ada (finished above Mya)\n2. Mel (finished above Ada)\n3. Mya (finished below Ada)\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Mya finished last",

Each paragraph provides some context, stating that there is an order in which they are newer (or older). The order is as follows:\n\n1. The motorcycle is newer than the convertible.\n2. The convertible is newer than the truck.\n\nFrom these statements, we can determine that the truck is newer than the motorcycle, as the convertible is newer than the motorcycle, which in turn means the convertible is newer than the truck. So the order is:\n\n1. truck --> convertible --> motorcycle\n\nStep 2: Compare this order to the options provided.\n\nOption (A) claims that the convertible is the oldest. However, we now know that the truck is older than the convertible, which means the convertible is not the oldest.\n\nOption (B) claims that the motorcycle is the oldest. We have already deduced that the motorcycle is newer than the truck and convertible, which means the motorcycle cannot be the oldest.\n\nOption (C) claims that the truck is the oldest. Our new order of vehicles matches this option, as the truck is older than the convertible, which in turn is older than the motorcycle.\n\nStep 3: Output the correct option.\n\nSince our deduction process aligns with Option (C) and no other option matches the order, we can confidently state:\n\nAnswer: (C) The truck is the oldest.",
