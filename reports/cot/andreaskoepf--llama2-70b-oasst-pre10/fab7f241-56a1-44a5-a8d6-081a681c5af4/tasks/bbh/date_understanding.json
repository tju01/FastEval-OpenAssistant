In this case, we decrease the day by 13, letting it be 13, subtract the remaining 1 from the 7 days, and arrive at 14 of October, and the day 14 then remains the same unchanged.\n\nStep 6: Play-out the remaining days:\n  As it's now 14-10-1924, the next step involves subtracting the remaining 5 days (i.e., 7 - original 2 remaining days) to end up with the correct date.\n\nStep 7: Compute the final date:\n  14-10-1924 - 5 days = 9-10-1924.

Today's date: 09/22/2021. Subtract 1 year and account for the saved leap day.
