            "model_answer": "There isn't a clear definition of \"murti\" in English. However, \"murti\" could be interpreted as a combination of the words \"murta\" (Hindi) or \"moot\" (Sanskrit) which means \"form\". To find the possible translation, I will match the definition word-to-word with the given answer choices.\n\n- (A) Offerings: This answer choice does not make sense and does not relate to the definition.\n- (B) Prayers: Though offerings are sometimes part of prayers in various cultures, \"murti\" does not generally translate into prayers.\n- (C) Apparitions: This answer choice does not make sense and does not relate to the definition.\n- (D) Idols: This is the most likely translation for \"murti\". \"Murti\" is commonly used to depict deities in Hindu or Buddhist temples, which are referred to as \"idols\".\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (D) Idols.",

It is a form of art that is both beautiful to look at and has a deep spiritual meaning. The goal of Ikebana is to create a harmonious balance between the flowers, their containers, and the space they are placed in.\n\nThe other options listed are not related to flower arranging.

The Sikh scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib, is primarily composed of Shabads, which are considered to be revelations from God.\n\n(B) Khalse: Khalse is a term that is not associated with Guru Nanak or Sikhism, so it is unlikely that he used this term to denote the divine word.\n\n(C) Nam: Nam is a term used in Sikhism to refer to the name of God. While it is related to the concept of the divine, it is not specifically used to refer to the divine word as part of divine revelation.\n\n(D) Guru: Guru is a term used in Sikhism to refer to the spiritual teacher or guide. While the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh scripture, is considered to be the eternal Guru after Guru Nanak, Guru Nanak himself did not use the term \"Guru\" in this sense to refer to the divine word.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Shabad.\n\nAnswer: (A) Shabad",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) Muhammad's miraculous ascent to heaven\n\nThe mi'raj is a significant event in the life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) as described in Islamic tradition. It is believed to have occurred after the migration of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) to Medina. \n\nThere are various accounts of the mi'raj, but one of the most widely accepted narrations is that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was miraculously transported from Mecca to Jerusalem one night, and then ascended to the seventh heaven, where he met with the angels and finally with Allah SWT (God Almighty). It is also believed that during this journey, he was given instructions for Muslims to perform daily prayers, and was shown the exact direction of the Ka'ba, the most sacred site in Islam.\n\nBased on this background information, we can eliminate option B (Muhammad's migration to Mecca) and C (Muhammad's first community in Mecca) as they are events that occurred before the mi'raj.\n\nOption D (Muhammad's revelations of the Qur'an) is not directly related to the mi'raj, although it could be argued that the verses that were revealed to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) after the mi'raj contain some teachings about the journey and its significance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Muhammad's miraculous ascent to heaven.",

The word \"Qur'an\" comes from the Arabic root \"qara'a,\" which means to recite or read aloud. This is because the Qur'an was originally recited and memorized by the Prophet Muhammad and his companions, and it was not written down until many years after his death.
