            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The term for a sub-optimal but acceptable outcome of negotiations between parties is \"compromising\".\n\nFor this question, I looked up alternative words for negotiations that have sub-optimal outcomes and found \"bargaining\", \"compromising\" and \"accepting\". However, \"bargaining\" means trading something for something of equal value, which implies a win-win situation. \"Accepting\" means to agree to or acquiesce in (a proposal or request), which does not necessarily imply negotiations. \"Satisficing\" means accepting the first option that meets certain criteria as opposed to maximizing a given objective, which is a closely related concept but not a direct term for negotiations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) compromising, which means settling for a solution that neither side is completely happy with, but that is still acceptable. It is an important skill in negotiations as it allows both parties to come to an agreement without a winner or a loser.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is (D) compromising.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The term for the 'rule of thumb' type of bias in decision making is \"Heuristics\".\n\nI will explain the reasoning step-by-step.\n\n- The question first mentions 'rule of thumb' type of bias in decision making. \n- 'Rule of thumb' bias is a type of cognitive bias, which is a mental shortcut that people use to make decisions.\n- The question then lists four options: Framing bias, Hindsight bias, Over-confidence bias, and Heuristics.\n- 'Framing bias' refers to the tendency to frame information in a way that makes it more salient or meaningful. Although it is a cognitive bias, it does not specifically refer to 'rule of thumb' type of bias.\n- 'Hindsight bias' is a bias in which people overestimate their ability to have predicted an outcome after it has occurred. Again, it is a cognitive bias, but not specifically targeting 'rule of thumb' bias.\n- 'Over-confidence bias' refers to the tendency to be too confident in one's abilities or predictions. While a type of cognitive bias, it does not specifically address 'rule of thumb' bias.\n- 'Heuristics', on the other hand, are mental shortcuts or simplified strategies used to make decisions. 'Rule of thumb' bias refers to the use of heuristics, which are not always accurate and can lead to biased decision making.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) Heuristics.",

            "question": "What is a normative perspective?\n\n(A) The way things are.\n(B) The way things are going to be.\n(C) The way things should be.\n(D) The way things were.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Option (C) The way things should be, is the correct answer.\n\nHere's the reasoning behind it:\n\n - **Option (A)**: \"The way things are\" refers to the current state of affairs, as in the existing conditions or realities. However, a normative perspective is concerned with values, judgments, and evaluations of what is good or bad, right or wrong, or desirable or undesirable. Merely stating the current state of affairs does not necessarily address these normative questions.\n - **Option (B)**: \"The way things are going to be\" represents a predictive or anticipatory stance, based on assumptions or expectations of future developments. A normative perspective focuses on moral, ethical, or aesthetic principles, rather than making predictions or projections about the future.\n - **Option (D)**: \"The way things were\" reflects a retrospective or historicist approach, emphasizing the past or previous states of affairs. While normative perspectives may draw on historical precedents or cultural traditions, they primarily focus on what should be rather than what once was.\n - **Option (C)**: The way things should be aligns with the essence of a normative perspective. Normativity entails evaluating and prescribing how things should be, based on some criteria or standards of value. It goes beyond descriptions of how things are or predictions of how they will be, and involves making judgments and recommendations about what is desirable or appropriate. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer.\n\nHence, the answer is (C) The way things should be.",

Mention the four forces that were just listed in the question: potential for entry into the industry, threat of substitute products, power of customers, and level of rivalry. \n4.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The term \"transformational leader\" refers to a type of leader who inspires and motivates their followers to achieve high levels of performance and change, while also displaying a high degree of integrity and ethical behavior. The question asks which of the following political leaders could not be termed a \"transformational\" leader:\n\n(A) Margaret Thatcher\n(B) Mikhail Gorbachov\n(C) Nelson Mandela\n(D) Bill Clinton\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider each leader's leadership style, accomplishments, and impact on the political landscape.\n\nMargaret Thatcher: Thatcher was a British politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990. She implemented policies that transformed the British economy, including privatization and deregulation. Her leadership style was characterized by strong determination and a willingness to take bold actions. Based on these factors, Thatcher could be considered a transformational leader.\n\nMikhail Gorbachov: Gorbachov was a Soviet politician who served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1982 to 1991. He implemented policies that led to the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Despite facing significant resistance from within his own party, he persisted in his efforts to modernize and liberalize the Soviet system. Based on these factors, Gorbachov could also be considered a transformational leader.\n\nNelson Mandela: Mandela was a South African political leader who spent 27 years in prison for his opposition to apartheid. Upon his release, he played a key role in negotiating the end of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic government in South Africa. His leadership style was characterized by his ability to inspire and unite people from different backgrounds, as well as his dedication to peace and reconciliation. Based on these factors, Mandela could also be considered a transformational leader.\n\nBill Clinton: Clinton was an American politician who served as the 42nd President of the United States from 1993 to 2001. He implemented policies that helped to create a strong economy and reduce inequality, as well as promoting gun control and health care reform. His leadership style was characterized by his ability to appeal to a broad range of voters and his strong communication skills. Based on these factors, Clinton could also be considered a transformational leader.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nThere is no clear answer to the question as all four leaders have demonstrated transformational leadership qualities. However, if we must choose one, we could argue that Bill Clinton could be considered less transformational than the other three leaders as he did not face nearly as much opposition or resistance in his efforts to implement policy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Bill Clinton.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) Work schedule design.\n\nA Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that is commonly used to visualize a project schedule. It shows the start and end dates for each task in a project, as well as the duration of each task. The horizontal axis of the chart represents time, while the vertical axis represents tasks or activities. The bars on the chart represent the duration of each task, and the vertical line that bisects the chart represents the current date.\n\nBy using a Gantt chart, project managers can easily see the status of each task in a project, as well as the overall progress of the project. They can also identify any potential conflicts in resource allocation or scheduling. Gantt charts are widely used in industries such as construction, manufacturing, and software development, among others.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question \"What is a Gantt chart a type of?\" is (B) Work schedule design. A Gantt chart is a tool that helps project managers plan, schedule, and control their projects, making it an essential tool for project managers and teams alike.",

            "model_answer": "The term for power derived from status or position in an organisation is called \"Legitimate Power\".\n\nExplanation:\nLegitimate power is a form of power that is derived from the formal authority of a position. It is based on the fact that a person holds a specific position or title within an organisation and has the right and authority to make decisions, give orders, and allocate resources.\n\nLegitimate power is often associated with roles such as managers, supervisors, and executives, who have formal authority over others within an organisation.

This leaves us with Henry Fayol and Max Weber as the key writers to consider. Fayol and Weber both wrote on topics like administrative science, management, and business and government. However, Weber focused much more on the interactions of individuals and power in bureaucratic contexts, whereas Fayol saw bureaucracy more as a system of moving paperwork through organizations.
