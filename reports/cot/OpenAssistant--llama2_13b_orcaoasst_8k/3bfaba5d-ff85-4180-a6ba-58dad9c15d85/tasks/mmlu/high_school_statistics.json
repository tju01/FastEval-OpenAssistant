            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of normal distribution and the central limit theorem.\n\nFirst, we know that the waiting times for a new roller coaster ride are normally distributed with a mean of 35 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes. This means that the distribution of waiting times is bell-shaped, with most waiting times clustered around the mean value of 35 minutes and a few extreme values occurring on either side of the mean.\n\nNext, we know that there were 150,000 riders the first summer. This means that the number of waiting times we have to consider is equal to 150,000.\n\nTo calculate the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders, we need to find the percentage of waiting times that fall within this interval. According to the central limit theorem, we can approximately treat the waiting times as a normal distribution with a mean of 35 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes, even though the actual distribution is unknown.\n\nWe can use z-scores to find the percentage of waiting times that fall within a given interval. A z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations a value is away from the mean. For example, a z-score of +2 means the value is 2 standard deviations away from the mean in the positive direction.\n\nTo find the percentage of waiting times that fall within an interval [a, b], where a < b, we can use the following formula:\n\nP(a < Z < b) = (b - a) / (\u03c3 * \u221a(12))\n\nwhere P() is the percentage, Z is a normal z-score, a is the lower limit of the interval, b is the upper limit of the interval, \u03c3 is the standard deviation, and \u221a(12) is a constant.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values we know to find the percentage of waiting times that fall within the interval [25.3, 35], which corresponds to the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders.\n\nP(25.3 < Z < 35) = (35 - 25.3) / (10 * \u221a(12))\nP(25.3 < Z < 35) = (10.7) / (3.16 * \u221a(12))\nP(25.3 < Z < 35) = (10.7) / (3.516)\nP(25.3 < Z < 35) = (10.7 / 3.516) * 100%\nP(25.3 < Z < 35) = 3.04%\n\nTherefore, the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders is (25.3, 35), which corresponds to option (C).\n\nHowever, we should note that we made some assumptions in our calculations, such as the waiting times being normally distributed and the actual distribution of waiting times being unknown. Therefore, we cannot be completely certain that our answer is correct without more information.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I can help you with that!\n\nLet's start by defining what hypothesis testing is. Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine whether a particular hypothesis is true or false, based on a sample of data. The null hypothesis (H0) is the hypothesis that there is no difference between the observed data and the expected data, while the alternative hypothesis (HA) is the hypothesis that there is a difference.\n\nNow, let's go through each of the statements one by one and determine whether they are true or false:\n\n(A) If there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 10% level, then there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 5% level.\n\nFalse. The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis at the 5% level is a separate decision made based on the evidence. If there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the 10% level, it does not necessarily mean that there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 5% level. The 5% level is a different decision threshold that requires different evidence.\n\n(B) Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered.\n\nTrue. Whether to use a one-sided or a two-sided test depends on the nature of the hypothesis and the direction of the alternative hypothesis. The decision is typically made after the data are gathered, based on the research question and the nature of the data.\n\n(C) If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\nFalse. The chance of rejecting the null hypothesis at a particular level depends on the evidence in the data. The level of the test is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if it is false, not the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. A test conducted at the 1% level can have a different chance of rejecting the null hypothesis depending on the evidence in the data.\n\n(D) The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.\n\nTrue. The power of a test is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. It refers to the test's ability to detect a difference when it actually exists in the data. The power of a test depends on several factors, including the size of the effect, the sample size, and the significance level of the test.\n\nIn summary, statement (A) is false, statement (B) is true, statement (C) is false, and statement (D) is true.\n\nNow, let's see the final answer, in a single letter with parenthesis:\n\nB",
