It states that the coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers produced by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\n\nNow let's compare the two statements and determine their relationship:\n\n1. There is no direct relationship or overlap between linear regression and AdaBoost.\n2. The first statement discusses estimation variances specifically in linear regression, while the second statement focuses on the coefficients \u03b1 in AdaBoost.\n3. There is no inherent connection between linear regression estimators and the coefficients \u03b1 in AdaBoost that would allow us to conclude whether both statements are true or false.\n\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that the answer is (B) False, False, indicating that neither statement 1 nor statement 2 is necessarily true or false in relation to the other.",

There are 3 possible values, so there are 3 ways to assign a class to an example:\n\n0, 1, or 2\n1, 2, or 3\n2, 3, or 0\n\nNext, let's consider the 2 possible values for attribute 1:\n\n0 or 1\n1 or 2\n\nWe can't assign both values to the same attribute, so we can count each of these cases as half an example.\n\nFor attribute 2, we have:\n\n0 or 1\n1 or 2\n\nEach case counts as half an example.\n\nFor attribute 3, we have:\n\n0 or 1\n1 or 2\n\nEach case counts as half an example.\n\nFinally, for attribute 4, we have:\n\n0 or 1\n1 or 2\n\nEach case counts as half an example.\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of possible values for each attribute by the number of possible values for the class:\n\n12 possible values * 3 possible values for class = 36 possible combinations\n\nHowever, we counted each possible value for each attribute twice, once for each of its possible assignments.

They use convolutional layers to extract features from the input images, which makes them well-suited for image classification tasks. Additionally, CNNs are often implemented with large amounts of data, so they can learn complex relationships between image features.\n\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a type of neural network that are designed to process data that has a graph-like structure, such as images. They use message passing algorithms to propagate information between nodes in the graph, which makes them well-suited for tasks such as image segmentation and object detection.\n\nFully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNs) are a type of neural network that connect every input neuron to every output neuron. They are well-suited for tasks such as regression and classification, but they can be slow to train and require a large amount of data to learn complex relationships between input and output features.\n\nRBF Networks are a type of radial basis function network, which are a type of neural network that use radial basis functions to model the relationships between input and output features. They can be used for tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering, but they can be sensitive to the choice of RBF kernel and can be difficult to train on large datasets.\n\nGiven the advantages and disadvantages of each type of network, and the fact that high-resolution images have a lot of spatial structure, I would say that (A) convolutional networks are the best choice for classifying high-resolution images in 2020. This is because CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks and are often implemented with large amounts of data that allow them to learn complex relationships between image features. Additionally, there has been a lot of research on improving the performance of CNNs for image classification tasks, which makes them a strong contender for this problem.\n\nAnswer: (A) convolutional networks",

Since we are updating the parameter w with the gradient g, the number of parameters in the cost function (D) remains the same, and the number of samples in the dataset (N) does not change as well. However, the number of computations involved in updating the parameter w depends on the shape of g, which is typically of the order of N or N^2.\n\nThus, the cost of one gradient descent update is dependent on the number of computations involved in updating the parameter w, which is typically of the order of N or N^2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) O(ND^2).",
