While this may be a difficulty in some cases, it is not specific to the access matrix approach to protection. Other approaches may also have large matrices that are difficult to manage.\n\nOption (B) states that the access matrix is not capable of expressing complex protection requirements. This is a significant difficulty, as the primary purpose of using an access matrix is to express protection requirements. If the approach is not capable of expressing complex requirements, it may not be suitable for many real-world scenarios.\n\nOption (C) states that deciding whether a process has access to a resource is undecidable. This is related to the decidability of the access matrix, which is a separate question from the difficulties of using the approach.\n\nOption (D) states that there is no way to express who has rights to change the access matrix itself.
