Since Joe can choose either an apple, an orange, or a banana at each meal, there are 3^3 = 27 possible outcome combinations.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of outcomes where Joe eats at least two different kinds of fruit. To do this, we can find the number of outcomes where Joe eats only one kind of fruit and then add the number of outcomes where Joe eats two or three different kinds of fruit.\n\nFor the first case, where Joe eats only one kind of fruit, we can choose which fruit he eats at each meal. Therefore, there are 3^3 = 27 possible outcomes for this case.\n\nFor the second case, where Joe eats two different kinds of fruit, we can choose which two fruits he eats at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Therefore, there are 3 choose 2 = 3 possible fruits for each meal, and we can rearrange these to get a total of 3^6 = 729 possible outcomes.\n\nFor the third case, where Joe eats three different kinds of fruit, we can choose which three fruits he eats at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Therefore, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 possible fruit for each meal, and we can rearrange these to get a total of 3^6 = 729 possible outcomes.\n\nAdding these two cases together, we get a total of 27 + 729 + 729 = 1135 possible outcomes for Joe to eat at least two different kinds of fruit.\n\nFinally, we need to determine the probability of this event by dividing the number of outcomes where Joe eats at least two different kinds of fruit by the total number of outcomes.

Since $f(0)=f(-2)=5$, we have the inequality $5<f(1)<9$.\n\nNow we need to determine the minimum value of $f(1)$. To do this, we can use the constraint that $f(x)$ passes through the point $(-2,5)$. We know that $f(-2)=5$, and since $f(x)$ is continuous, we can conclude that $f(1) \\in [5,9]$. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(1)$ is $5$.\n\nFinally, we need to determine the maximum value of $f(1)$. To do this, we can use the constraint that $f(x)$ passes through the point $(2,9)$.

We are looking for all positive integers \"$n$\" that satisfy the condition that $n^2$ is a factor of $1200$. We will start by sorting this list of numbers:\n\\begin{enumerate}[(I)]\n\\item $2^2 = 4$, $4^2=16$, $6^2 = 36$, $8^2 = 64$\n\\item $10^2 = 100$, $11^2 = 121$, $12^2 = 144$, $13^2 = 169$\n\\item $14^2 = 196$, $15^2 = 225$, $16^2 = 256$, $17^2 = 289$\n\\item $18^2 = 324$, $19^2 = 361$, $20^2 = 400$, and level $21$ begins at $4096$\n\\end{enumerate}\nWe start by identifying what the sum is at each level of the list. From level (I) to (I), the sum is $4 + 16 + 36 + 64 = 120$. From level (II) to (II), the sum is $100 + 121 + 144 + 169 = 534$. From level (III) to (III) the sum is $196 + 225 + 256 + 289 = 1076$. From level (IV) to (IV) the sum is $324 + 361 + 400 + 4096 = 5061$. Therefore, the sum of all numbers up to level (V) is\n$$\n5061 + \\sum_{i = 5}^{10} \\sum_{j = 1}^{20} \\frac{j^2}{i^2} = 5061 + \\frac{20^2}{5^2} + \\frac{40^2}{6^2} + \\frac{60^2}{7^2} + \\frac{80^2}{8^2} + \\frac{100^2}{9^2} + \\frac{120^2}{10^2} + \\frac{140^2}{11^2} + \\frac{160^2}{12^2} = 5733.52\n$$\nAll of the numbers on the list in the question have exactly two factors, $2$ and an odd integer (less than or equal to the square root of the number itself). If the square of this odd integer is a factor of $1200$, then the square of the number itself is also a factor of $1200$. Therefore, the number must be one of the numbers we identified in the original list, or a multiple of one of them. For example, $12^{3/2}$ is a factor of $1200$. The number can only be the square of an integer if that integer is $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11$ or $12$, because at level (IV), there is only one number (4096) that satisfies the condition. For example, the square of 12 is 144, which is a factor of $1200$. There are 6 other multiples of 12 on the list (36, 1176, 2352, 3528, 4704, and 6880) that are also factors of the square of an integer. Therefore, the sum of all positive integers up to level (V) that satisfy the condition is $5733.52 + 6 * 144 = 5825.48$.\n\nThe answer is therefore (C) 36.\n\nNote that if the question had asked for the number of integers that satisfied the condition, instead of the sum of their values, the answer would be $14$ (12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 84, and 96), which is two more than the number we found in our previous step (6). This is because of multiples of each of the integers we found earlier. For example, the sum of all integers up to level (V) that are multiples of 12 is $1176 + 2352 + 3528 + 4704 + 6880 = 18832$. We therefore need to subtract this value from our sum of values to get the number of integers rather than the sum of their values.",
