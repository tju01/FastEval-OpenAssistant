            "question": "Typical advertising regulatory bodies suggest, for example that adverts must not: encourage _________, cause unnecessary ________ or _____, and must not cause _______ offence.\n\n(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial\n(B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious\n(C) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial\n(D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the meaning of each of the words in the question and what regulations they are referring to. \n\n1. The first word is \"encourage\". This implies that the advertisement should not urge or persuade people to do something.\n2. The second word is \"unnecessary\". This means that the advertisement should not promote products or services that are not necessary or useful.\n3. The third word is \"cause\". This implies that the advertisement should not lead to or result in some sort of action or effect. \n4. Finally, the last word is \"offence\". This means that the advertisement should not upset or insult people in some way.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can see that the words are referring to laws or guidelines related to advertising. We can also see that the correct answer must contain \"Safe practices\" and \"Distress\". \n\nThe correct answer is (D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious. \n\nThe reasoning behind this answer is that advertisements must not encourage unsafe practices (which could lead to harm or injuries), cause unnecessary distress, jealousy, or cause serious offence to consumers. These regulations aim to protect consumers from false or misleading advertisements and to ensure that advertisements do not exploit or manipulate consumers in any way.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(D) Employer duties\n\nThis question has two options labeled (B) Employee rights and (C) Employer duties. These labels suggest that there are two possible outcomes. However, we can eliminate the option (B) immediately because rights and obligations are two parts of a series of related concepts, but they are not mutually exclusive. \n\nThe basic concept of employee obligations means that workers are required to fulfill certain responsibilities to their employer. On the other hand, employer duties refer to the obligations of employers towards their workers in terms of creating a safe and productive work environment. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the correct answer is (D) Employer duties, as this option best represents the type of obligations that employers have towards their workers.\n\nWhile it is true that employer duties are not the only obligations that exist in a workplace relationship, they are the foundation for all other obligations and rights that are established. Without clear employer duties, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for workers to know what is expected of them, and for employers to know what they can expect in return. Therefore, the answer to this question is (D) Employer duties.",

            "model_answer": "I will analyze each option and cross-check them with the information provided in the question.\n\nOption (A) Presenteeism: Presenteeism refers to the practice of attending work when sick or otherwise unfit to perform one's duties. This option does not fit the description provided in the question, as it does not mention work-related or non-work-related activities.\n\nOption (B) Absenteeism: Absenteeism refers to the practice of staying away from work without valid reasons. This option also does not fit the description provided in the question, as it does not mention work-related or non-work-related activities.\n\nOption (C) Work-play balance: This option could fit the description provided in the question, which talks about an employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities. However, this term is not commonly used to describe this concept.\n\nOption (D) Work-life balance: This option fits the description provided in the question. Work-life balance refers to an employee's ability to effectively manage their work and non-work responsibilities. The question clearly mentions that this issue has become hotly contested in recent years, further supporting option (D) as the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (D) Work-life balance.",

The passage starts by mentioning \"their natural counterparts\", which refers to ecosystems.\n\n2. The passage then states that industrial ecosystems are comprised of a balanced network of interdependent organisms and their environments, which is similar to the concept of ecosystems in nature.\n\n3. The passage states that industrial ecosystems add value to sustainability thinking because they consider companies and industries to be dependent on each other and interconnected through the flow of resources and wastes.\n\n4. Based on these steps, it can be concluded that the term being described in the passage is \"Industrial ecosystems\".\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) Industrial ecosystems.",

To do that, I will analyzing the constraints and threats for these collaborations step-by-step:\n\n1. Power imbalance: This constraint suggests that one party in a collaboration may have more control or resources than the other, leading to unfair distribution of these assets. This can result in one party gaining more from the relationship than the other, which is often referred to as \"hoodwinked.\"\n\n2. Informational asymmetries: This constraint refers to an imbalance in the information available to the two parties in a collaboration. This can result in one party having an advantage over the other, which can lead to co-opting of the other party.\n\n3. Resources: This constraint refers to the availability of resources to one party, which can lead to an imbalance in the collaboration, ultimately resulting in one party gaining more benefits than the other.\n\nStep-by-step explanation ends here.\n\nThe answer to the question is:\n\n(B) Power imbalance, Resources, Co-opted.\n\nThese options describe the limitations and risks of business-CSO collaborations: (B) Power imbalance, (C) Informational asymmetries, (D) Informational asymmetries, (C) Informational asymmetries, (D) Informational asymmetries, (B) Power imbalance, respectively.

Of the other options, (A) hedonistic utilitarianism focuses on pleasure and pain induction, which may not align with all shareholder preferences, (C) The Categorical Imperative is a fundamental principle of Kantian ethics that focuses on duties and obligations rather than preferences, and (D) ethics of care is typically focused on the well-being of individuals or groups rather than profit maximization.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) preference utilitarianism.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

            "model_answer": "Milton Friedman believed that the sole responsibility of business is to its shareholders. This view is embodied in his famous saying \"The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits.\" Here's why:\n\n1. Friedman believed that the primary purpose of a business is to make a profit for its shareholders. He argued that this is both ethical and efficient, as profits provide the incentive for investors to provide the capital that businesses need to operate and innovate.\n2. Friedman believed that businesses should not try to serve broader social goals, such as environmental protection or equal opportunities for workers. He argued that trying to do so would distract businesses from their primary purpose and make them less efficient.\n3. Friedman did acknowledge that businesses have a role to play in society beyond just making profits. For example, he argued that businesses should follow the law and act in a socially responsible way that does not harm third parties.\n\nBased on these points, the answer is (A) The only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders.",

Therefore, it is a strong candidate for the correct answer.\n\nFlexible: The term \"flexible\" accurately describes working practices that involve temporal, spatial, and task-related fluidity. It conveys the idea that these practices are adaptable and can adjust to changing circumstances or requirements.\n\nModern: While modern working practices may involve some degree of fluidity, the term \"modern\" does not specifically capture the temporal, spatial, and task-related aspects of fluidity that the question is referring to.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Flexible.",
