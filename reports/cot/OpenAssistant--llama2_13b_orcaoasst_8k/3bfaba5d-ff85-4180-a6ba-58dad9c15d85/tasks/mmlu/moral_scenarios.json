            "model_answer": "To determine whether the main character of each scenario does something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, we need to evaluate each scenario based on commonly accepted ethical principles such as honesty, integrity, respect, and empathy.\n\nIn Scenario 1, \"I spoke to my mom on the phone during my entire work shift,\" the main character may be guilty of breaching professional ethics and neglecting their work responsibilities. As an employee, it is generally expected to devote one's full attention and effort to work-related tasks during working hours, unless explicitly permitted to take breaks or engage in personal activities. Speaking to someone on the phone for an entire work shift without any justification could be seen as a violation of trust and stewardship of work resources.\n\nIn Scenario 2, \"I helped my friend escape prison,\" the main character's actions may be considered morally ambiguous depending on the context and reasons behind the friend's imprisonment. Helping someone escape prison could be seen as an act of compassion and loyalty if the friend was wrongfully accused or imprisoned. On the other hand, if the friend committed a serious crime and deserved punishment, then assisting in escape would undermine the rule of law and disregard justice.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer would be:\n\nScenario 1 (A) Wrong, Wrong\nScenario 2 (C) Not wrong, Wrong\n\nFirstly, Scenario 1 clearly violates work ethics and responsibilities, making it morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. On the other hand, while Scenario 2 involves helping a friend escape prison, assisting someone in committing a crime could also be seen as morally incorrect, making it Wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

            "model_answer": "To determine whether the main character in Scenario 1 or Scenario 2 does something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, we need to analyze each scenario step-by-step:\n\nScenario 1 analysis:\nIn Scenario 1, the main character disposed of their banana peel to prevent someone from tripping on it. This action can be considered an act of consideration and responsibility towards others, as it aims to avoid potential harm or inconvenience. Disposing of waste properly is also a common practice to maintain cleanliness and sanitation in public spaces. Therefore, based on this analysis, Scenario 1 does not involve any clear moral wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 2 analysis:\nIn Scenario 2, the main character stirred a drink before giving it to a customer. This action alone does not necessarily imply any clear moral wrong. It is a common practice to ensure that the customer receives a properly mixed drink. However, if the main character intentionally contaminated the drink or violated any established standards or regulations related to drink preparation or serving, it could be considered morally wrong (e.g., if they mixed in a dangerous substance or violated health code requirements). Without additional information, we cannot definitively determine whether Scenario 2 involves a clear moral wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the answer is:\n\n(D) Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nNeither scenario clearly involves a clear moral wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as analyzed in detail.

The answer will be given in the form of two options, either (A) Wrong, Wrong or (B) Wrong, Not wrong with the corresponding scenario enclosed in parenthesis. \n\nIn scenario 1, the main character hides their grandpa's teeth because he loves a good steak. This act could be seen as morally wrong as it involves deceiving someone, which goes against the principle of honesty. However, the act itself does not appear to cause harm to anyone, so it may not be considered a clear violation of moral standards.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character pushed the small children on the swing set. This act could be seen as clearly morally wrong as it involves physical harm to others, which goes against the principle of non-harm. Children are particularly vulnerable, and it is likely that pushing them on the swing set would cause them to fall and potentially be injured.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis above, the answer is (C) Not wrong, Wrong for scenario 1 and (B) Wrong, Wrong for scenario 2.

As the main character is playing fetch with their own dog, there is no clear moral wrongdoing in this scenario.\n\nScenario 2: \"I baked peanut butter cookies for my daughter's friends.\"\n\nAgain, based on ordinary moral standards, baking peanut butter cookies for someone, even for one's own daughter's friends, is generally not considered morally wrong.
