This can be done by substituting sqrt(18) in for x in the above minimal polynomial:\n\n(sqrt(18)^2 - 18) = (3^2 - 18) = -4\n\nSo the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q(sqrt(18)) is:\n\nx^2 - 4\n\nFinally, we can take the product of the two minimal polynomials to find the minimal polynomial of the whole field extension:\n\n(x^2 - 4)(x^2 - 18) = (x^4 - 36x^2 + 72x - 36)\n\nNote that the degree of a polynomial in Q[x] is given by the highest power of x in the polynomial. In this case, the highest power of x in the minimal polynomial is 4, so the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is:\n\n(D) 6",

Let p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) in S_5: This step defines a particular element p in the symmetric group S_5. The elements of S_5 are all possible permutations of the integers 1 to 5, and a permutation can be represented as a product of transpositions. In this case, p is a product of two transpositions:\n   - (1, 2)\n   - (5, 4)\n\n2. Find the index of p in S_5: To find the index of p in S_5, we need to determine the position of p in the symmetric group's ordered list of elements. However, the question specifies an ordered list of elements, which is not the same as the Cayley table representation of S_5. So, I'll assume the question is referring to the Cayley table representation and will use it to determine the index of p.\n\n3. The Cayley table representation of S_5 has 5 rows and 5 columns, with each cell representing the result of applying a permutation to an element of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. We can write p as a product of its elementwise representation:\n   - (1, 2) = (1, 2)\n   - (5, 4) = (5, 4) * (1, 2) = (5, 4)(1, 2)\n\n   Since (5, 4)(1, 2) is a permutation in S_5, its representation in the Cayley table must be an element of {(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 3, 5, 2, 4), (1, 4, 5, 2, 3), (1, 5, 2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 4, 5, 1), (2, 4, 5, 1, 3), (2, 5, 1, 3, 4), (3, 4, 5, 1, 2), (3, 5, 1, 2, 4), (4, 5, 1, 2, 3), (5, 1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 1, 3, 2, 4), (5, 1, 4, 2, 3), (5, 2, 1, 3, 4), (5, 2, 3, 1, 4), (5, 2, 4, 1, 3), (5, 3, 1, 2, 4), (5, 3, 2, 1, 4), (5, 3, 4, 1, 2), (5, 4, 1, 2, 3), (5, 4, 2, 1, 3), (5, 4, 2, 3, 1)}.\n\n4. We can see that (5, 4)(1, 2) is equal to (5, 3)(4, 1), which is in the second row and second column of the Cayley table. So, the index of p in S_5 is (2, 2).\n\n5. Answer: (B) 2",
