By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value.

This suggests that Ghana may have been a site of gold mining and trade.\n\n(G) The fact that the king's interpreters, treasury officials, and ministers were Muslims suggests that Ghana had ties to the Islamic world, which could have included trade routes that brought goods from Asia to West Africa.\n\nTherefore, we can say that while there is no direct evidence in the passage of trade with Asia by Ghanians, there is reason to believe that Ghana may have been involved in trade with the Islamic world and other parts of Africa, which could have included interactions with Asian traders.",

Firearms were expensive and difficult to obtain from Europeans, and their impact on African societies was limited.\n\nOption (C): It is not accurate to say that Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves. While European demand for slaves contributed to the slave trade in Africa, Africans were also involved in the slave trade as traders, captors, and sellers.\n\nOption (D): There is no evidence to support the assertion that Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (None of the above). Traders from Sub-Saharan Africa would sell anything of value to European merchants, including goods produced locally as well as valuable items such as ivory, gold, and slaves, for goods such as textiles, metal tools and weapons, and liquors.
