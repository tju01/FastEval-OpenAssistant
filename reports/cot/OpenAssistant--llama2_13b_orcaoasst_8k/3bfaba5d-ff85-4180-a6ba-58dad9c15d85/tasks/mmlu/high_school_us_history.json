The Treaty of Washington was signed in 1871 and set the boundary line between British Columbia and American territory at the 49th parallel. This allowed the United States to take possession of the land and it became known as the Oregon Territory. This also marked the end of the American-British rivalry in the region, and helped to further stabilize the border between the two countries.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer to the question is (B) Launching the Second New Deal, a series of legislative acts including Social Security.\n\nReasoning:\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to political challenges like that of Senator Long by launching the Second New Deal, a series of legislative acts that aimed to address the economic and social issues faced by the country during the Great Depression. The Social Security Act, which was part of the Second New Deal, provided a system of old-age, survivors, and disability insurance, and helped to reduce poverty and provide economic stability for the elderly and disabled. This move was aimed at addressing the concerns raised by Senator Long and other political challengers, and demonstrating that the government was committed to addressing the needs of its citizens. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer.\n\nWhy the other options are incorrect:\n\nOption (A) Announcing that he would not run for re-election: There is no evidence to suggest that President Roosevelt responded to Senator Long's challenge by announcing that he would not run for re-election. In fact, Roosevelt was re-elected twice and served as President until his death in 1945.\n\nOption (C) Diverting people's attention by allowing the Japanese to bomb Pearl Harbor: This option is not supported by historical evidence and is a conspiracy theory. There is no evidence to suggest that President Roosevelt intentionally allowed the Japanese to bomb Pearl Harbor in order to divert attention from domestic political challenges.\n\nOption (D) Urging Congress to cut taxes and deregulate the economy: While President Roosevelt did implement some tax cuts and economic policies aimed at stimulating the economy, he also implemented a range of policies aimed at reducing poverty and improving the living conditions of Americans. The Second New Deal, which included the Social Security Act, was a major part of this effort. Cutting taxes and deregulating the economy were not the only, or the most significant, response to political challenges like that of Senator Long.",

He made a sharp distinction between his frequently reiterated personal wish that 'all men everywhere could be free' and his official duties as a legislator, congressman, and president in a legal and constitutional system that recognized the South's right to property in slaves. Even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he continued to declare his preference for gradual abolition. While his racial views changed during the Civil War, he never became a principled egalitarian in the manner of abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass or Wendell Phillips or Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner.\"\n\u2014Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial, 2010\nHow did President Lincoln's issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation alter the course of the Civil War?\n\n(A) The war came to a swift conclusion because the Proclamation made the Confederacy realize the futility of their cause.\n(B) The war grew in scope because the Proclamation caused Great Britain to join the fight on the side of the Union.\n(C) President Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy vowed massive resistance to any Union effort to free the slaves.\n(D) The war aims of the United States were no longer exclusively focused on the preservation of the Union.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Option (A) is incorrect. The Emancipation Proclamation did not cause the Confederacy to realize the futility of their cause. It is true that it helped to weaken the economic basis of the Confederacy by depriving them of much of their labor force. Also, it bolstered the morale of the Union troops, freeing them from indirectly supporting slavery. However, it did not lead to a swift conclusion of the war.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect. The Emancipation Proclamation did not cause Great Britain to join the fight on the side of the Union. The primary reason why Great Britain did not join was because of economic factors, but also because of the widespread popular support for the Confederacy among many British elites and the population.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect. President Jefferson Davis did not vow massive resistance to any Union effort to free the slaves. In fact, he argued very publicly that it was the Union Army that would be decimated and destroyed by arming slaves. The Confederacy was primarily fighting for slavery, but tried to avoid admitting it publicly.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect. The war aims of the United States were still primarily focused on the preservation of the Union, but there now was also a specific goal of abolishing slavery tied to the war.\n\nThe correct answer is (A). While the Emancipation Proclamation did not end the war immediately, it did fundamentally alter the U.S.'s goal in fighting it. Before the proclamation, the Union was fighting primarily to preserve the U.S. as one nation; the war had become so costly and toxic that slavery rather than the Union seemed to many to be at stake. Lincoln's decision to issue an anti-slavery proclamation transformed the war from a conflict among states about constitutional principles into a crusade to eradicate black servitude. An increasingly radicalized, more racist Confederacy had by 1863 lost much of its support in Europe. While Great Britain did not enter the war on behalf of the Union, the Emancipation Proclamation certainly made it more uncomfortable to do so and helped to keep European powers from interfering with the Union's efforts. Abolitionists were also inspired to to renew their efforts. Many white Southerners either deserted or surrendered, as continued resistance to the Union started to look like resistance to emancipation. Because slaves made up such a large proportion of the Confederate workforce, military defeat without emancipation would have almost assured the eventual restoration of slavery in the South. After emancipation, the Union's goals shifted to reconstructing the reunited states not just as a single nation, but as nation in which blacks were citizens equal to whites.",
