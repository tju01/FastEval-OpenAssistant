            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

            "model_answer": "The most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation is (C) compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- The patient had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks, which could have caused swelling or inflammation in the leg, which could potentially compress the nerve.\n- The patient had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage and required anticoagulant therapy, which could have led to the needed placement of an IVC filter, which could have put pressure on the femoral nerve.\n- The patient had a hematoma of the left thigh, which could have caused compression of the nerve.\n- None of the other options are listed as direct causes of decreased sensation in the patient's left thigh in the given information.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation is compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.",

She had been having regular contractions every 4\u00a0minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6\u00a0hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100%\u00a0effaced and 7\u00a0cm dilated. The most likely diagnosis is\n\n(A) Braxton Hicks contractions\n(B) lower uterine retraction ring\n(C) hypotonic uterine dysfunction\n(D) primary dysfunctional labor",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for the described patient is (C) hypotonic uterine dysfunction.\n\nHypotonic uterine dysfunction, also known as arrested labor or protracted labor, occurs when a patient's contractions become weak, irregular, or stop altogether, despite being in active labor. This can be caused by inadequate oxygen and nutrient supply to the uterine muscles, fatigue, dehydration, or narcotic analgesics.\n\nIn this case, the patient is having regular contractions that have now become intermittent and weak. Additionally, she has received medication for pain twice in the past 6 hours, which can contribute to weak contractions. These factors suggest that the patient's labor has become hypotonic, or weakened in strength.\n\nThe other diagnoses, such as Braxton Hicks contractions, lower uterine retraction ring, and primary dysfunctional labor, are less likely in this scenario. Braxton Hicks contractions are usually mild and irregular, and do not typically cause the cervix to dilate to 7 cm. A lower uterine retraction ring can cause arrest of descent and obstructed labor, which is not seen in this case. Primary dysfunctional labor is a rare condition that occurs in approximately 1% of pregnancies, and is characterized by weak, irregular contractions that do not progress labor. While this could potentially be a diagnosis, it is less likely given the other factors present in this case.\n\nTherefore, hypotonic uterine dysfunction is the most likely diagnosis for the patient described.",

His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold.

The statistical significance (p=0.04) in a small difference in means provided by an independent t-test is a convention used in peer-reviewed research reporting of positive findings.

Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces.

During this period, she has had tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger. The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of which of the following on the right?\n\n(A) Median nerve at the wrist\n(B) Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm\n(C) Radial nerve at the forearm\n(D) Ulnar nerve at the elbow",

            "model_answer": "Based on the given information, the most likely cause of the numbness, tingling, decreased sensation, and severe pain in the right hand is entrapment of the Ulnar nerve at the elbow. Here are the reasons for this conclusion:\n\n1. The patient complains of numbness in her right hand, specifically in the ring and small fingers. This suggests involvement of a nerve that supplies these fingers.\n2. She experiences tingling in these same fingers, further supporting nerve damage.\n3. The examination shows decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch over specific areas in the right hand. This finding is consistent with compression or damage to a nerve.\n4. Palpation of the right elbow elicits severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. This pain specifically localizes to the affected nerve distribution.\n5. The most common entrapment neuropathy is cubital tunnel syndrome, which results from compression of the Ulnar nerve at the elbow. The symptoms described by the patient closely align with this condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Radial nerve at the elbow. The patient does not have pain or numbness in the radial distribution, and the other options are less likely based on the given information.\n\nFinal answer: (C)",

            "model_answer": "The question is about the physiological effect of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia induced in healthy subjects during a study of muscle metabolism by outputting malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA inhibits fatty acid oxidation in the liver, which converts excess glucose to fatty acids. Therefore, the most likely answer is (A) Fatty acid oxidation.\n\nTo determine whether this answer is correct, let's break down the information provided in the question:\n\n1. Hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia are induced in healthy subjects: This means there is an increase in blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) and an increase in insulin levels (hyperinsulinemia).\n2. Muscle biopsy specimens show increased concentrations of malonyl-CoA: Malonyl-CoA is an acyl-CoA molecule that is involved in fatty acid synthesis and inhibits fatty acid oxidation.\n\nNow, let's look at the answer options:\n\n(A) Fatty acid oxidation: Malonyl-CoA is known to inhibit fatty acid oxidation, particularly in the liver. Increased levels of malonyl-CoA would likely lead to a decrease in fatty acid oxidation.\n(B) Fatty acid synthesis: While increased levels of malonyl-CoA can stimulate fatty acid synthesis, inhibition of fatty acid oxidation is more closely associated with malonyl-CoA.\n(C) Gluconeogenesis: Gluconeogenesis is the process of producing glucose from non-carbohydrate sources like amino acids and glycerol. While gluconeogenesis can occur in response to hyperglycemia, it is not directly inhibited by malonyl-CoA.\n(D) Glycogenolysis: Glycogenolysis is the process of breaking down stored glycogen into glucose. It does not involve the control of malonyl-CoA levels.\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely answer is (A) Fatty acid oxidation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Fatty acid oxidation.",
