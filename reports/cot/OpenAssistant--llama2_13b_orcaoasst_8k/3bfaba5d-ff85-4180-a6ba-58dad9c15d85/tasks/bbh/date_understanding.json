There are no days missing, since December 24th falls within the 12 months of the year. This means we can simply move on to the next day.\n2. December 25th, 1937, falls on a Tuesday, according to the Zeller's congruence formula for XVIII century Europe. Since each century does not begin on January 1st, the approach to leap year is different, so we have to use a more complex formula to get the correct day of the week. In our case, 1937 is a leap year due to the fact that it is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400. This means that February still has 29 days, and January, March, May, July, August, October, and December all have 31 days. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeller%27s_congruence for more detail.\n\nBased on these observations, we can conclude that tomorrow is December 25th, 1937.

We know that today's date in the UK format is 02/01/1987.\n2. We need to find the date a month ago, so we need to subtract one month from today's date.\n3. Since the UK format uses day/month/year, we need to start by changing the month to fit this format. The month \"February\" must be in second position, so let's move it there: 02/02/1987.\n4. Now we need to subtract one month, which means we need to reduce the month by 1. Since the month is currently 02 (February), we need to turn it into 01 (January) to fit the pattern. Consequently, the new date is 01/02/1987.\n5. However, we were instructed to subtract one month from the date, not one month from the month. So we need to repeat step 4, except this time, we'll start with the month 01 (January) and subtract one month: 12/02/1987.\n6. We're still not at the desired answer, so we need to repeat step 5 again, again starting with the month 12 (December) and subtracting one month: 11/02/1987.\n7. Repeating step 5 one final time gives us the answer: 10/02/1987.\n8. We're still not at the desired answer format of MM/DD/YYYY, so we need to adjust the month, which is currently 10. Since we started with the month February in step 3 (which is number 2 in the 12-month year), we need to step back 11 months: October, November, December. Starting with December, we count back through the months to get to February: 01/12/1987, 02/11/1987, 03/10/1987, 04/09/1987, 05/08/1987, 06/07/1987, 07/06/1987, 08/05/1987, 09/04/1987. After that, we have October, November, and December, which gives us the final answer: 03/02/1987.\n\nTherefore, the date a month ago in the MM/DD/YYYY format is option (C): 03/02/1986.",

            "model_answer": "First, we need to convert the number of days passed since Jane quit her job into a date. Dividing 176 by 365 (the number of days in a year) gives us 0.48458333... days, which is approximately 49 days. We can therefore simply add 49 days to March 20th, 2020 to get the date. This is July 9th, 2020.\n\nNext, we need to determine what date is one week ago from today. Since we don't know what day today is, we can simply subtract 1 week from the date we found above, which is November 20th, 2020. This gives us November 13th, 2020.\n\nThe answer is therefore (C) 08/15/2020.

We did not completely disregard (C) 08/15/2020, however, because we found that date to be a valid answer and disregarded other potential answers that could not logically be correct.",

We aren't given information about the month, so I'll assume January for now. \n\nIt is her 5th visit to the bookstore today. We don't know the current month, so I'll assume it's still January, and this is her 5th visit, so the first visit was on October 16, 2009.\n\nIn one visit cycle, Jane visits the bookstore on every 16th of the month, so we don't need to account for the time before October 16th. \n\nTherefore, we don't need to consider October to January. So the cycle we have is from January 16th, 2010, to the present day. \n\nThe next milestone day would be February 16th, 2010. \n\nTherefore, today is most likely February 16th, 2010.\n\nWhen we look at the options, we see that the only option that fits is (D) - 02/16/2010.\n\nSo the answer is (D) 02/16/2010.\n\nNote that I used a lot of assumptions in this problem, since we weren't given a lot of information, and we need to make some inferences, for example assuming that Jane could only visit the bookstore once a month one 16th of any month, and that she would visit the bookstore on the 16th of January, 2010, but that she started visiting in October 2009. Therefore, this should be taken as a probable correct answer, rather than a certain correct answer. You may also want to keep the calender in mind when solving this problem.",
