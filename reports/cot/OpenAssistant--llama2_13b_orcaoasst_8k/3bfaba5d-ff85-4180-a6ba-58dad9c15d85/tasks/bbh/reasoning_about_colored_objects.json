Subjectively, the colors could be instead described as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, brown, purple, pink, and some blend of turquoise and magenta.

This leaves:\nred, orange, yellow, green, blue, brown, purple, pink, and teal.\n\nNext, I would eliminate any colors that match the first listed color, which is the silver envelope. Four colors are left that must correspond to the four objects: yellow, orange, green, and purple.\n\nHowever, the color of the third listed object is the black booklet, so I would eliminate yellow and purple since black can't be either of those colors. This leaves the objects in reverse order as: purple (ok), orange, teal, and green.\n\nUsing the same elimination process, I can determine that the purple color must be the color of the teal plate, since we can eliminate pink, fuchsia, brown, burgundy, and mauve, as well as magenta, gray, gold, and burgundy. The only option left is H, which corresponds to the teal color.\n\nThus the answer is H, which means that the color of the right-most object is teal.\n\nThe answer to the question is (J).",
