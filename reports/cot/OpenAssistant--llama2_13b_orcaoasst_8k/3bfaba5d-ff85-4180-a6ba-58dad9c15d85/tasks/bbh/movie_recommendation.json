IMDb Rating: The suggested movies should have a relatively high IMDb rating to indicate a good quality.\n\nBased on the above criteria, here are some movie suggestions:\n\n1. \"Quiz Show\" (1994): This movie is a drama that tells the story of a 1950s quiz show scandal. It has an IMDb rating of 7.4.\n\n2. \"True Romance\" (1993): This movie is a crime comedy directed by Tony Scott, known for other crime dramas like \"The Fugitive.\" It has an IMDb rating of 8.2.\n\n3. \" neben K\u00fcssen geht nichts\" (1993): This is a German movie that roughly translates to \"Nothing Goes beyond Kissing\" and is a crime drama about a shady businessman, his lover, and a young woman. It has an IMDb rating of 7.6.\n\nSo, the answer (B). \"Looney Tunes Back in Action\" is not a good fit for the given options. And the lesser known movie \"neben K\u00fcssen geht nichts\" may be a good fit.",

These attributes are likely to be shared by a movie that is similar to all four movies. I'll start out by looking at each movie separately and then compare them to all four.\n\n1. Star Wars Episode VII - The Force Awakens\nThe movie is a space opera that centres on the battle between the First Order and the Resistance. It features iconic characters such as Han Solo, Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker. It also utilizes futuristic imagery, epic battles and adventure to tell a compelling story.\n2. Inside Out\nThe movie centres on a young girl's emotional journey as represented by various emotions such as joy, fear, anger and sadness that reside in her mind. The film uses a unique animation style and explores complex themes such as memory and family relationships.\n3. Pulp Fiction\nThis movie is a crime thriller that uses nonlinear storytelling to follow various characters involved in the criminal underworld. The film features Tarantino's distinctive style of dialogue and violence and explores complex themes such as morality, loyalty and redemption.\n4. Raiders of the Lost Ark\nThe movie follows adventurer Indiana Jones as he sets out to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis can get their hands on it. The film features thrilling action sequences, mythical elements and iconic characters such as Jones and Sallah the Arab.\n\nFrom this analysis, I can pinpoint several common themes and traits that all four movies share. Firstly, they all use fantastical elements such as space opera, imaginative animation and adventure. Secondly, they all explore complex themes such as family relationships, morality and loyalty. Finally, they all utilize unique storytelling techniques such as nonlinear narratives and visual style to tell their story.\n\nBased on these observations,  the best option would be (D) Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex  But Were Afraid to Ask. The movie shares the same characteristic of using a unique style of storytelling and tackling complex social issues. Although it is not a space opera or action adventure, it does use fantastical elements such as talking horses and singing vegetables to tell its story. Furthermore, it explores themes such as love, sex and relationships which are also present in the other four movies.\n\nHence, option (D) is the most appropriate answer.\n\n(D)",

While it may have some similarities to Die Hard With a Vengeance in being an action thriller about a person trapped in danger, there would be very little crossover appeal with Apollo 13 and Forrest Gump. \n-Option (B) Stealth is a science fiction action film about an unmanned aerial vehicle that goes rogue. Forrest Gump and Die Hard With a Vengeance both involve people inimical to the main characters, but there are no mechanized menaces as the main conflict in either of those films. At best there may be some overlap in appeal with Jurassic Park for a movie that involves wild animals that are a threat to humans. \n-Option (C) The Last Man on Earth is a science fiction horror film about a man who is seemingly the only living person left in a world that has been devastated by a mysterious plague. It is unlikely that there would be much crossover appeal between this movie and any of the other three films you have indicated. \n\nWell, that help much? One potential answer might be \n\n(D) True Lies, which is a spy action comedy that stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as a secret agent who must juggle home life with his wife Jamie Lee Curtis while also dealing with a new mission. While it is not as scientifically based as Apollo 13, and does not involve dinosaurs or spacecraft, it does share a sense of action and the sort of lighthearted comic tone that pervades Jurassic Park. It also features a character who is considerably slower mentally than their situation demands, which bears a certain similarity to Forrest Gump. True Lies also involves a conflict where dealing with hostile individuals and obstacles is the main conflict in the movie, rather like Die Hard With a Vengeance. \n\n\nYou may now give your final answer of the option that is most similar to Apollo 13, Jurassic Park, Die Hard With a Vengeance, Forrest Gump: (D) True Lies.",

            "question": "Find a movie similar to Toy Story, The Mask, Batman, The Lion King:\nOptions:\n(A) Exit Wounds\n(B) Punch-Drunk Love\n(C) Seeking Justice\n(D) Pretty Woman",
            "correct_answer": "(D)",
            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that!\n\nWhen trying to find a movie that is similar to Toy Story, The Mask, Batman, and The Lion King, we need to look for films that share common elements or themes across multiple genres. These movies all have animated characters, action, comedy, and drama, so we should look for a movie that fits all of those categories.\n\nOption A, Exit Wounds, is an action-thriller that doesn't have animated characters or comedy, so we can eliminate it. Option B, Punch-Drunk Love, has animated sequences but is more of a romantic comedy-drama, so it's not quite right. Option D, Pretty Woman, is a romantic comedy, but it doesn't have action or animated characters, so we can eliminate it too.\n\nThat leaves us with Option C, Seeking Justice. This movie is a legal thriller with animated sequences and elements of action, comedy, and drama. It features a protagonist who seeks justice for a crime that has been committed against him and his family, which sounds like a theme that could fit with The Lion King. It also has a range of characters, including those who are comedic and those who are serious, which could appeal to audiences of Toy Story and Batman.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Seeking Justice. I hope that helps!",

            "question": "Find a movie similar to The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, Schindler's List, Braveheart:\nOptions:\n(A) The Bank Job\n(B) Robot Carnival\n(C) Dances with Wolves\n(D) The Family Stone",
            "correct_answer": "(C)",
            "model_answer": "The movie that I believe is closest in style to The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, Schindler's List, and Braveheart is (C) Dances with Wolves. Here's why:\n\n- Sure-footed, sweeping epic narratives: All four films have an epic scale and focus on historical events and characters. Dances with Wolves is set in the American West during the Civil War and follows a Union officer who befriends a pack of wolves and lives with them for a year.\n- Complex, multi-layered characters: The protagonists in all four films are well-developed, multi-dimensional characters who undergo significant personal growth over the course of the films. Dances with Wolves follows Kevin Costner's character as he goes from a cynical, alcoholic soldier to a protector of the wilderness and the animals that live there.\n- Rich, stylistic storytelling: All four films use a range of techniques to tell their stories, from nonlinear narratives to vivid imagery. Dances with Wolves mixes live-action with computer-generated imagery to create a visually stunning portrayal of the wilderness and its inhabitants.\n- Powerful music scores: The music scores for The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, Schindler's List, and Braveheart are all iconic and help to elevate the emotional impact of the films. Dances with Wolves features a stirring score by John Barry that effectively conveys the film's themes of adventure, hope, and redemption.\n\nTherefore, I think that the best answer is Dances with Wolves.",
