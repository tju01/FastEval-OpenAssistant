The paragraph states that on a branch, there are three birds: a blue jay, a quail, and a falcon. This means that there are three objects in total, which are the three birds mentioned.\n2. The paragraph also states that the falcon is to the right of the blue jay. This means that the falcon's position is to the right of the blue jay's position.\n3. Finally, the paragraph states that the blue jay is to the right of the quail. This means that the blue jay's position is to the right of the quail's position.\n\nFrom this information, we can conclude that since the falcon is to the right of the blue jay, and the blue jay is to the right of the quail, the falcon must be located between the blue jay and the quail.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is: (C) The falcon is the second from the left.",

            "model_answer": "For this task you need to determine [A] or [B] or [C] that describe the finish order of Mel, Ada and Ana in the golf tournament. But first you need to note that you have three statements, with which you could come to a conclusion. all three statements have the same sentence structure: <golfer1> finished before <golfer2>, and <golfer3> finished last. You should compare each pair of statements, and note down the letters for each statement that fits. Once you have done that, correlate the extracted letters to the options [A], [B], [C] to figure out which statement describes the correct finish order. \n\nFor example, looking at the pair of statements \"Mel finished last. Ana finished second.\" you note down the letters LL. Looking at the second pair of statements \"Ada finished before Ana. Mel finished last.\" you note down the letters ABLL. Correlating the extracted letters to the options, you can see that options AB correspond to the pair of statements \"Ada finished before Ana. Mel finished last.\", so you can conclude that the correct finish order is \"Ada finished first, Mel finished last, Ana finished second.\" \n\nThis is how I extract options from three expressions given, and if you have any question about it, feel free to ask until you understands my reasoning clearly.\n\n[A] - ABLL",
