Since the art studio was closed after 10pm, Sarah could not have gone there after 6pm. Since Jennifer saw Sarah working out at the gym from 3pm to 6pm, Sarah could not have gone to the art studio between these hours. Therefore Sarah could have gone to the art studio between 8am and 6pm, as between these times she was either asleep, at the bike shop, train station or the mall. \n\nNow let's take the first sighting of Sarah. Richard saw Sarah buying a bike at the bike shop from 9am to 12pm.One possibility is that Sarah went to the art studio between 12pm to 3pm. However since Betty saw Sarah waiting at the train station from 12pm to 1pm, she could not have gone to the art studio during this time.

He can also not have gone to the coffee shop after 7pm because Nancy saw him walking in the garden from 6pm to 7pm, and the coffee shop was closed after 7pm. Let's look at the other options:\n\n- Option (A): 6pm to 7pm. This is a possibility, as Nancy saw William walking in the garden from 6pm to 7pm, and the coffee shop could have been open during that time.\n- Option (B): 9am to 11am. This is possible too, as Linda saw William playing tennis from 9am to 11am, and the coffee shop could have been open during that time.\n- Option (C): 11am to 1pm. This is possible as well, as Emily saw William attending class from 11am to 1pm, and again, the coffee shop could have been open during that time.\n\nSo, William could have gone to the coffee shop at any time between 6pm to 7pm (option A), 9am to 11am (option B), or 11am to 1pm (option C). None of the options exclude each other, so it's possible that William went to the coffee shop multiple times during the day.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n(A) 6pm to 7pm\n(B) 9am to 11am\n(C) 11am to 1pm",

            "correct_answer": "(B)",
            "model_answer": "It is claimed that Hannah went to the beach today. We will use Ockham's razor to find the most likely answer and we also have some links between these activities with different times given.\n\nFirstly, we are given Hannah's wake time: 5AM\n\nObviously, if she woke up at 5AM and went to the beach within the next 45 minutes (7:30AM), we would not be able to observe her in other activities around other times. Especially with her last activity being near to 8PM, and considering the beach hours, this time frame is extremely unlikely.\n\nThe last Elizabeth saw Hannah was at 8PM. We can eliminate this entire time frame.\n\nSo we can look at earlier times. As we've seen, Richard observed Hannah from 5AM to 7AM. It is still likely that she could have done other things beforehand, however the observability drastically decreases as the earlier we go.\n\nAshley saw her get coffee, so we can eliminate the period from 9AM to 8PM.\n\nFinally, Jennifer observed her near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 7PM to 8PM.\n\nSo, Hannah could have, logically gone to the beach, in theory, between 5AM and 7AM.\n\nAmong the given choices, (B) 7am to 9am is the most likely time for Hannah to have gone to the beach, followed by (C) 9am to 7pm as there is no evidence she could have gone to the beach during (A) 7pm to 8pm due to hours of operation. With the most likely window classified, between when she woke up at 5am to when she sat on a rooftop from 5am to 7am, we can concur that Hannah could have gone to the beach within that window.\n\nSo the answer is (B) 7am to 9am.",
