We know that we are removing 3 notebooks since we have a total of 3 grey notebooks and 3 grey cat toys.\n\nThis means the total number of grey objects will decrease by the number of notebooks we're removing. \n\nSo, let's subtract 3 (the number of notebooks to remove) from the original total of 3 grey objects.\n\nTotal grey objects (before removing notebooks) - Number of notebooks to remove = 3 - 3 = 0\n\nNow let's see the answer provided and matching it with our result:\n\n0 (O) Fourteen\n\nThe answer given is (O) Fourteen, which doesn't match the answer we got. There is an error with the options or question. The correct answer according to your question translates to option (O) Fourteen and it should be (O) fourteen or just (O) fourteen.

The problem states that we have three magenta mugs, three red fidget spinners, three red keychains, and two magenta cups on the desk.\n2. Our goal is to determine how many mugs will remain on the desk after we remove all the red items.\n3. To do this, we need to subtract the number of red items we want to remove (the sum of fidget spinners, keychains, and one magenta cup since we're taking away only the red mug) from the total number of magenta items on top of the desk (three magenta mugs and two magenta cups).\n\nNow, let's see what happens with each step:\n\n1. The difference in fidget spinners, keychains, and one magenta cup is 1+1+1 = 3 red items. This means there are 3 * 3 - 3 = 6 - 3 = 3 - 1 = 2 magenta mugs remaining.\n2. But the question is asking for the number of mugs left on the desk, not mugs taking away. Therefore, we need to find out how many more magenta mugs we have than the mugs taken away.\n\nSo, the answer is 3 (total magenta mugs) - 2 = 1 magenta mug.
