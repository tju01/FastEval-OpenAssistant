However, the problem asks how many penguins are MORE than 8 years old, so we cannot dismiss this option since we're also looking for the number of penguins who are just at 8 years old and did not exceed it.\n\nLast penguin:\n- Name: Gwen\n- Age: 8\n- Height (cm): 70\n- Weight (kg): 15\n\nGwen is more than 8 years old, but we have no information about the age of penguins who were precisely 8 years old.

We have 5 penguins with ages less than 5 and weights less than 12 kg. As these penguins satisfy the criteria (age > 5 and weight > 12 kg), we will not count them.\n\n2. Now, we have one penguin left in the table: Louis. He satisfies the criteria of age being more than 5 (since 7 is greater than 5) and his height is 50 cm, which is not enough to exceed 12 kg (since 50 cm = 50/100 = 0.5 m, and 0.5 m * 100/0.5 m = 200 kg). So we will not count him.\n\nBy counting the number of penguins that satisfy the criteria, there are no penguins more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg, so the answer is:\n(A) 0",
