            "model_answer": "Calculating the degree of a field extension follows these steps:\n\n1.Q is called the field base, so we know the smallest polynomial with integer coefficients whose roots include the elements of the field base. In our case, Q is a field with 0, 1, and negative integers. So, Q([x]) is:\n(x) = 0, (x\u00b2) = 1, (x\u00b3) = 0, (x^4) = -1\n(x5), x6, x7, .... are these polynomials set at 0 according to our property set. The degree of Q, say d1, is the largest power of x in any of these terms.\n2.To find the degree d2 of the field extension Q((sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18))) over Q, we simply add the relevant terms into the polynomial of Q((sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)):\n(q((sqrt(2),sqrt(3),sqrt(18)))=(x,(sqrt(2),(sqrt(3),(sqrt(18))))\n\nAgain, the degree of any polynomial is the largest power of x in any of the terms. So, the degree of our field extension is the largest power of x in any of the terms of the small polynomial\nand the given field extension (sqrt(2),sqrt(3), sqrt(18)).\n\nDue to our restriction on x and the coefficients (1 and -1), the degree of the extension can never be larger than 2 or smaller than 0. \n\nThe smallest possibility that places our Right end of our ranges will be when the multiplication of two powers actually exceeds degree of the field x (2i)\n(I have not gotten to the power of 4 with existing replaceable x yet). E.g., 2^2 =4, and every following power will exceed degree 2 once the four-power is attained since the only higher power grantable is 4^k, when k >1.\n\nSo, if you look at (x^4) = -1, which stands for -1 copied to 0^times in the question therefore we can multiply 2x with -1 which equals 1 which is already 10% of 1 + 1 = 2, and 4x with -1 = 1 ,which is about half of 2, and so on. \n\nHowever, the given polynomial in the extension doesn't have the property nor does the polynomial with the built-in x parameter built into the outlined algebra connect with the terms their means to multiply the x by. So, the degree of the given field extension Q((sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18))) over Q is 0, because there's no link even after multiplication in the x set up to connect the y terms well, including multiplication by -1 for all powers not rising to 4 yet. \n\nNow with reporting requirements we know a solution is not possible. So for a problem with no solution we \"pick up the smallest number solution vector\" in this case that is 0, and hope the world works out accordingly.",

Since there are only 4 zeros in a 4-degree polynomial, we should apply the fundamental theorem of polynomial arithmetic to this polynomial: \n\nLet's see what the 4 zeros are:\nOn the absolute x-axis:\nx = 0 (since every term in the polynomial has degree at least 1)\n\nOn the lines y = x and y = -x:\nx = 1, -1 (since the polynomial has zeros on y = x or x = y)\n\nThat's already 3 zeros, so let's find the 4th zero. To find the remaining zero, divide the polynomial by the greatest common factor of its coefficients. However, since the coefficients are already in the finite field of Z_5, a divisor is equal to its inverse modulo 5. Adding the inverse modulo 5 of a term to its coefficient, we have the following:\n\n0 = x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x + (1^5 - 3^3 - 1^2 - 2^1)\n\n0 = x^5 + x^5 + (3_5 - 2_5)\n0 = 2x^5\n\nNow let's solve this equation step by step to determine the other 4th zero:\n\n1.

It implies that the resultant factor group is independent of the original group's non-Abelian nature.\n\nStatement 2: If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\nIn this case, the statement is suggesting that if H is a normal subgroup of G, and K is a normal subgroup of H, then K will be a normal subgroup of G. This means that if there is a normal subgroup K within H, then that subgroup will exist in G too as a normal subgroup.\n\nNow let's consider the options:\n\n(A) True, True\nThis would mean both statements hold, which can lead to contradiction (diagonal statement A).

But as you can see from the previous explanation, Statement 1 and Statement 2 can have different meanings and contexts.\n\n(C) True, False\nIf Statement 1 were true, then every factor group of a non-Abelian group would also be non-Abelian.

To determine the degree of the given field extension, we need to find out how many elements are in Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) that are not in Q itself.\n3. Given that this is a field extension, any element in the field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) is of the form ax + by + sqrt(2)z + sqrt(3)w, where a, b, z, and w are rational numbers. We can recursively find all possible rational coefficients as follows:\n   - If a is irrational and x is rational, then a can be written in the form of p/q (p, q are integers) and x can be expressed as a fraction p/q (q \u2260 0). Note that the coefficients z and w are always squared.\n   - If x is irrational and y is rational, then z and w need to be multiplied by sqrt(3). This results in bad rationals resulting in z = 1 and w = 1/4.\n   \n4.
