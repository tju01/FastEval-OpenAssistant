            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(C) 0.45%\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total revenue per day\nYou charge $245 per hour, so if your car runs for 2 hours a day on average, you make about $245 x 2 = $490 per day in revenue.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total estimated revenue per year\nYou'll have to subtract your daily cost as well, which is $50 per day. So the estimated revenue per year is $490 per day x 365 days = $176,150 (as you work every day of the year including any festivities and weekends).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the yearly yield\nFinally, you divide this revenue by your total initial investment in the limo, $98,000. \n\nYield = Yearly Revenue / Cost\nYield = $176,150 / $98,000\n\nSimplifying the equation leads us to find the yield as 0.45, solving for C from the given options. So, the estimated yearly yield on your investment is 0.45%. This makes sense given that it's a long term investment.",

            "question": "Arno Co. did not record a credit purchase of merchandise made prior to year end. However the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory. What effect did the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise have on Arno's balance sheet at year end? Assets Liabilities\n\n(A) No effect No effect\n(B) No effect Understated\n(C) Understated No effect\n(D) Understated Understated",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(C) Understated No effect\n\nExplanation: To answer this question, let's think about the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity (Common Stock). If you record a purchase of merchandise in the year-end physical inventory but don't record it in the financial records, it is considered an understatement of assets. This understatement of assets does not have an immediate effect on the balance sheet, as assets are recorded at historical cost.\n\nAs for liabilities, if we don't record the purchase, there is no further financial liability such as payment for the purchase. Hence, it does not have an immediate effect on Liabilities either. Based on the information provided, the omitted purchase will not modify the balance sheet at year end.\n\nAnswer: (C) Understated No effect",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.\n\nThe reason for choosing this option is that subsequent events are events that occur after the date of the financial statements but before the release and reporting of the financial information. \n\n(A) This procedure is focused on a specific situation (inventory items), which may vary in nature and does not represent a broad auditing practice.\n\n(B) Although internal controls can influence the auditor's assessment of the risks of material misstatement in an organization, it involves assessing validity rather than checking on the specific aspects of the financial statements related to subsequent events.\n\n(D) This is because the latest available interim financial statements may not necessarily have audited information about the subsequent events after they occur. The auditor's concerns are about whether there are additional relevant events not mentioned in the financial statements that could impact the outcome. While comparing the two documents, the emphasis is more on the balance sheet items under audit rather than subsequent events.\n\nTherefore, option (C) stands out as the most appropriate procedure because it involves inspecting whether there have been any transactions in the client's accounts that may impact the financial statements.

Dean had used the straight-line method, which is not the standard practice for amortizing a bond premium. The effective interest rate method is the better approach to amortize a bond premium, as it ensures that the actual outstanding bond amount reduces over time. \n\nWe know that a bond premium should reduce steadily over time according to the bond's effective interest rate. This reduction is a part of the Accumulated Amortization in a company's books. In Dean's case, using the straight-line method may somehow have caused an error.\n\nThe error wouldn't affect the bond carrying value at June 30, Year 12. As the bond is a debt instrument, the carrying value is determined by finding the fair value and not allowing errors in the amortization method. There was no indication of abnormal depreciation.\n\nYet, it could impact the Retained Earnings. If the Accumulated Amortization is understated due to the error, it may overstate the retained earnings since the premium paid for the bond may still have an impact on the net income. In this case, Dean used the straight-line method in error (giving levels of earnings potentially higher than they should be).\n\nSo, by considering premium should translate to reduced net income due to the amortization, it's reasonable to think that the Bond Carrying Value might be less affected than the Retained Earnings due to the error.\n\nHowever, to give a precise answer, we need more detailed information about the bond's amortization method and the company\u2019s general financial situation.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(C) It will no longer be depreciated.\n\nLet's look at why the other statements are correct and why statement (C) is incorrect.\n\n(A) It will be reclassified as an asset held for sale.\nOnce a company plans to sell an asset (in this case, the old building), it starts to treat that asset differently from its other assets. It will then reclassify the old building as an asset held for sale because the intention is to be sold to another entity.\n\n(B) It will be classified as a current asset.\nAs mentioned earlier, a company classifies an asset as a current asset if it expects to sell the asset within one year or if it's currently in use within the company's operations. In this case, the company expects to sell the old building in four months, which falls within the classification period of a current asset.\n\n(D) It will be valued at historical cost.\nProperty, plant, and equipment (PP&E), including buildings, are usually valued at their historical cost because it is the original cost to the company, excluding any gains or losses on disposal. Since the intention is to sell the old building, the sale price will be the value and not the historical cost.\n\nNow let's address why statement (C) is incorrect.\n\n(C) It will no longer be depreciated.\nA common accounting practice for buildings, like any other capital asset with a finite economic life, is to depreciate the value of the asset over its useful life to reflect its declining value. Since the company is planning to sell the old building rather than using it for the intended purpose, the company will no longer depreciate the building starting the date of reclassification. However, this does not mean the building's value goes to zero immediately. It just means that the depreciation expense account becomes zero, and the remaining cost is recognized as a separate asset.\n\nTo summarize, \n\n(C) It will no longer be depreciated - This has been verified by our explanations. It is still the correct answer from the options provided.",

Carson accurately reported $28,000 in gross income on Carson\u2019s individual tax return. If the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions to the owners had been proportionate, how much income would Carson have reported on Carson\u2019s individual return?\n\n(A) $28,000\n(B) $132,000\n(C) $160,000\n(D) $188,000",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To find out, we first have to understand how cash dividends and corporation ownership stake are related to individual tax returns.\n\n1. When a corporation (S or C) issues a cash dividend, it is to be reported on the individual's tax return. This includes the amount received by the shareholder as cash money. So, in our case, if the dividends were to be proportionate, the information given in the problem suggests that for every $42.86 (40% of $105) Carson gets in cash, the corporation deducted this amount from itstaxable income. This is the amount Carson would report as gross income.\n\n2. If there were no other considerations such as taxable income, deductions, etc., then the aggregate amount of income Carson reports would indeed be the same as $28,000. However, here, we introduce the second part of the problem: the amount itself is the amount Carson reported. This implies that the amount reported on the return is not related to the amount actually due to Carson, unless we take into account the distribution proportion mentioned.\n\nConsidering that if they were S corporation, then the distribution would have proportionate distribution. This means the distribution was not exactly equal to Carson's ownership percentage. Given that for every 40% of $400,000, the distributions to the owners were not exactly equal to 40% of what Carson received in cash. Since we do not have that data, we cannot establish the amount accurately.\n\nSo with the information given in the question, we can't be sure about what the answer would be for (E) or (F), i.e., if the distributions to owners had been proportional. Therefore, we go straight to the answer computed under the assumption that the distribution were proportional, that is $160,000 according to the calculations.\n\nIn Conclusion, given the information provided, the most accurate answer to this problem is: (C) $160,000.",
