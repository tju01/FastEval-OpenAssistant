Let's answer this question step by step to maintain coherence between learner and reasoning process. When a question involves more testing of hypothesis or other variables where possible true and false cases are involved, steps are essential to keep argument coherent and all-encompassing.

The formula for midpoint method is as follows:\n\n$f(c) = \\frac{f(-2) + f(2)}{2} + \\frac{c-(-1)}{2} (f((-2)+c)-f(-2)) $\n\nwhere $c$ can be any real value.\n\nSince $f(x)$ is strictly convex, even factors and odd factors will not multiply to form the midpoint difference because the graph of $f(x)$ is completely on one side of a straight line for all possible line segments drawn between two points in the $xy$ plane.\n\nIn this case, the straight line would be $(x,y) = \\lambda (3,-1)+(2,2)$ and the midpoint method formula becomes:\n\n$f(1) = \\frac{5 + 9}{2} + \\frac{1-(-1)}{2} (\\lambda-3) (f(3+\\lambda)-5+\\lambda)$\n\n$f(3+\\lambda)+f(-2+\\lambda) = 5 + \\lambda$\n\n$f(-2+\\lambda)+f(\\lambda) = 9 - \\lambda$\n\n$f(-1+\\lambda) = 9-\\lambda$\n\nThe f(1) values that will contribute to the middle portion of the graph lying above the line through (-2,5) and (2,9), are when f(-1+\\lambda) and f(-2+\\lambda) values are approximately equal. Since f(-2+\\lambda) is an even function, adding 1 to each of its coefficients will make it contribute fairly to the f(1) value for this interval. \n\nTherefore, applying the midpoint method with equal contribution from f(-1+\\lambda) and f(-2+\\lambda), we get\n\nAnother contribution comes from the interval [-2,-1] where since f is a strictly convex function, any interpolated value would be below the straight line segment with points (-2,5) and (-1,5) or (-2,9) and (-1,9). So, there is no preference on the side of origin, the f(1) value will be symmetrical with respect to 0 as well as on the sides.\n\nOn a straight line we have the equation: y=ax+b\n\nGiven that the limit  lim(a_1ln(x_1),x_1->0) is negative, then x0 is >0\n\nSo, the range of all possible values for f(1) are [-2,2].\n\nRecall that a strictly convex function will have the graph of y=f(x) lies below any straight line segment that connects any two points on the graph. Therefore, the range of all possible values for $f(1)$ will be below any straight line segment that connects the endpoints $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$, which is why we placed the limits in our interval.\n\nThe interval notation is: (-2,2)",
