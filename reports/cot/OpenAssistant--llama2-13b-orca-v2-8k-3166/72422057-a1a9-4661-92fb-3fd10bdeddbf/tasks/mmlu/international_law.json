            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, first let's understand the jurisdiction of various states in relation to crimes committed on board vessels.\n\n(A) The coastal State:\n- Generally, a coastal State has the right to monitor its territorial sea (12 nautical miles from the shore) and have the right to exercise jurisdiction over ships entering, leaving, or passing through that area.\n\n(B) The flag State:\n- The flag State is the State that the ship is registered under, and it has the primary responsibility for maintaining safety standards onboard the vessel.\n\n(C) All States enjoy such jurisdiction:\n- This option suggests that all States can exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels. However, this is not accurate, as jurisdiction is a function of law and geography, and is not universally applicable.\n\n(D) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea:\n- The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea is a court established to resolve disputes relating to maritime law. Although they could give their opinion on jurisdiction, they themselves do not usually exercise jurisdiction in these matters.\n\nHaving explained the jurisdiction of each state in this context, the answer is:\n\n(B) The flag State\n\nReasoning:\n- Generally, a flag State has the primary jurisdiction over crimes committed on board their vessels. However, there are other jurisdictions that could be involved, such as the coastal State or a different flag State. The jurisdiction of these different states depends on the specific situation and how it aligns with the respective state's legal framework.\n\nAnswer: (B) The flag State",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The Responsibility to Protect (R2P) is a more robust and systematic protocol than humanitarian intervention. R2P is guided by multilateral cooperation and impacts a broader range of stakeholders, whereas humanitarian intervention is more unilateral and often impulsive. Unlike humanitarian intervention, R2P is based on a larger framework, which makes it more reliable and sustainable in the long run. It is also more strategic and well-defined. Therefore, comparing these two concepts, R2P is less arbitrary.\n\nAnswer:\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "C) The so-called Lotus principle is that States are not prohibited to assert their enforcement jurisdiction on the high seas.\n\nThis answer is chosen because the Lotus principle is a concept in international law that is often used interchangeably with the term \"benevolent neutrality.\" The main principle behind the Lotus principle is that neutral States should not interfere with the enforcement jurisdiction of other Nations, even on the high seas. This means that a neutral state can assert its jurisdiction, such as confiscating contraband, in compliance with the law of another country.\n\nI won't extensively discuss the other choices since they are not accurate or precisely linked to the Lotus principle. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it reiterates what the Lotus principle entails rather than explaining it in detail. The \"whatever is not prohibited is permitted\" concept in international law is attributed to Hugo Grotius but is not directly linked to the Lotus principle.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Lotus principle does not only apply to deciding which Court States will submit their disputes to. The lotus principle expresses a country's neutrality and its enforcement jurisdiction.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because the Lotus principle is not focused on the concept of customary law as an origin or the combination of State practice and opinio juris. It is grounded in neutrality and the right of States to assert their jurisdiction within their borders, acknowledging the rights of others even on the high seas. Therefore, the correct answer, according to the detailed process of the Lotus principle, is choice (C).",

While the British Monarch is one source of power, there are several other sources of power in the Constitution, such as Parliament, Courts, and the Conventions/Principles of the Constitution.\n\n(B) The UK Constitution gives the judiciary the power to overturn acts of parliament\n\nThis statement is true. The UK Constitution does give judiciary the power (known as parliamentary sovereignty) to overturn acts of parliament in cases where such acts are deemed to violate fundamental rights or constitutional principles.\n\n(C) The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources\n\nThis statement is true. As mentioned above, the UK Constitution is an unwritten one, meaning it is not contained in a single document. It consists of several sources, including law, customs, conventions, and principles which define the structure and operations of the British state. These sources can be found in various documents, such as the 1701 Act of Settlement, 1215 Magna Carta, and the Parliamentary Sovereign.\n\n(D) The UK Constitution is based on a Bill of Rights\n\nThis statement is false. The UK does not have a codified, single Bill of Rights document that is used as the foundation of the constitution. The UK Constitution stems from several sources, and a Bill of Rights is merely one of them, like the 1689 Bill of Rights.\n\nAfter analyzing all the statements, the best description that fits the UK Constitution is:\n\n(C) The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources, and it depends on the correct understanding and interpretation of these various sources to apply it.",

This does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes\n(C) It is a peremptory norm of international law and all States have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute\n(D) It is an obligation which concerns solely international courts and tribunals",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes is that States have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means. This obligation is not specific to a particular outcome, as it does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes, but rather to try to resolve them peacefully. The peaceful settlement obligation is considered a peremptory norm of international law, meaning all States have a legal interest in safeguarding its application in any given dispute. However, this obligation does not apply strictly to international courts and tribunals, as it extends to all States involved in a dispute, regardless of the jurisdiction they may fall under.\n\nIn conclusion, the peaceful settlement obligation is present in international law through the obligation of conduct, where States should try to resolve their disputes peacefully. It is not an obligation of result, that is, they are not guaranteed to be resolved, but they should be tried through peaceful means. The obligation applies to all States, not solely to international courts and tribunals. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) It is an obligation of conduct, that States have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means.

This is not supported by any clear or reliable source or documented fact, and hence cannot be concluded as true.\n\n(B) The second statement states that Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility. However, a careful scrutiny of Protocol 14 texts does not show any additional admissibility criterion being added to the already existing standards for admitting cases.\n\n(C) The third statement claims that Protocol 14 eliminated the Commission of Human Rights. This is supported by the fact that there was no mention of the Commission of Human Rights in the Protocol 14 text.\n\n(D) This statement claims that Protocol 14 increased the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights. This could be true because it is mentioned in the text of Protocol 14.\n\nAfter reviewing this, the answer A is most false because there is no concrete documentation or source backing this statement.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To understand the meaning of international legal personality, we should analyze each option one by one.\n\n(A) This option suggests that only States are considered subject of international law. This statement is not incorrect; however, it does not comprehensively address the concept of international legal personality.\n\n(B) This option states that having the rights and duties under international law is a part of international legal personality, along with the ability to enforce these. This is a correct explanation, but it does not fully encompass all aspects of the concept.\n\n(C) This option suggests that an entity may challenge the authority of States. Though entities can challenge decisions and laws in their interactions with States, this statement does not include all aspects of international legal personality.\n\n(D) This option is focused on the distinction between legal and physical persons under international law. While this is an important aspect of the concept, it does not encompass all aspects of international legal personality.\n\nBased on the analysis of these options, none of them covers the complete meaning of international legal personality. However, we can combine elements from different options to better understand the concept.\n\nInternational legal personality (ILP) encompasses the recognition of an entity having rights and duties under international law, as well as the capacity to enforce these rights both legally and physically. Additionally, entities possessing ILP may exercise their rights to challenge or engage States or other entities when their rights are violated or to establish agreements and implement obligations under international law. \n\nThus, while option (B) is largely accurate, it doesn't give a complete picture. Combining elements from options (B), (C), and (D) provide us with a more comprehensive understanding of the meaning of international legal personality:\n\n(B + C + D) = It means having rights, duties and capacities to enforce under international law, and possessing the ability to challenge authority and engage in international obligations. \n\nSo, the answer is: (B + C + D) = It means having rights, duties, and capacities to enforce under international law, and possessing the ability to challenge authority and engage in international obligations. We can represent the answer using the provided options in the form (A + B + C + D). \n\nA + (B + C + D) = (A + B + C + D)\n\nNow, using the information present in options (A), (B), (C), and (D), we can evaluate and finalize the answer:\n\nA + (B + C + D) = (A + B + C + D)\n\nTherefore, the answer represents that the characteristics of an entity possessing international legal personality involve having rights, duties and capacities to enforce under international law, as well as being able to engage in rights enforcement, challenging authority, and engaging in international obligations. \n\nFinal Answer: A",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(D) The UN special mandates\n\nReasoning: \n\nA treaty-based human rights mechanism typically refers to a system that is guided by the principles and norms established by treaties, conventions, and protocols. These are often used to regulate human rights practices and ensure the protection of individuals.\n\n(A) The UN Human Rights Committee: This body is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)\u00a9 articulated a in a given country. It is not a system by itself but it indeed relies on treaties to carry out its objectives.\n\n(B) The UN Human Rights Council: This organization, while aiming to uphold and promote human rights, is more of an administrative and promotional body rather than a treaty-based human rights mechanism.\n\n(C) The UN Universal Periodic Review (UPR): It is a framework set up by the UN to review the world's human rights situations periodically. It operates on an agreement between member states to have their human rights records examined by fellow member states. This, again, is more about reporting and investigation rather than being a treaty that directly implements rights.\n\nD) The UN special mandates: These are sets of standards and practices developed to tackle specific human rights concerns, often times developed based on existing agreements within the UDHR\u00a9 framework. For illustration, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, for instance, has a mandate to investigate specific instances of torture as part of the treaty-based UDHR standard. In this sense, the special mandates can be seen as implementations of treaty-based rights.\n\nUpon careful assessment, it is clear that among the given options, the UN special mandates best fit the description as a treaty-based human rights mechanism. Since the primary function of a treaty-based human rights mechanism is to apply treaty-based agreements and norms, the other mentioned options are more administrative bodies or reporting mechanisms rather than treaty-based processes. \n\nSo, the answer as a single letter with parenthesis is: (D) The UN special mandates.",
