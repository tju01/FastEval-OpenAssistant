However, he is significantly more likely to write tickets for middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes. When confronted with this fact, the officer truthfully states that he has no idea why that is, and that it must simply be a coincidence. Unbeknownst to the officer, this behavior is tied to the fact that these men look like his father, with whom he had an abusive relationship as a child.

To identify which of these systems becomes a chemically-based sensory system, let's analyze their function step by step.\n\nStep 1: The Gustatory System\nThe Gustatory System is associated with the sense of taste. Taste involves the detection of molecules in foods by specialized cells called taste receptors.\n\nStep 2: The Auditory System\nThe Auditory System is connected to hearing, which refers to sounds that can be detected by the human ear. Sound waves are mechanical waves, which means they are transmitted through a series of vibrations in the air, water, or other materials.\n\nStep 3: The Olfactory System\nThe Olfactory System is linked to the sense of smell, which involves the detection of molecules in the air by specialized cells called olfactory receptors. These odor molecules are released by various sources, like plants, animals, and people, and can be detected via the olfactory system.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that the Olfactory System is the only sensory system that is mechanically based and chemically dependent since it detects small molecules released into the air. Auditory and Gustatory systems are both transmitted through mechanical vibrations, but they involve more physiological processes by detecting vibrations instead of chemical molecules directly. Thus, the Olfactory System is the chemically based sensory system.\n\nThe answer is:\n(C) III only",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria bound to (D) carnitine.\n\nReasoning:\nPhysiologically, fatty acids can only be transported into the mitochondria for the process of cellular respiration and energy production. Fatty acids are first bound to their corresponding acyl carnitine (FFAs concealed within carnitine) inside the lumen of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Then the complex is transported to the mitochondrial matrix through the mitochondrial carnitine uptake transporter. This process prevents the solubility and transport of fatty acids, thus simplifies their entry into mitochondrial intermembrane space.\n\nFatty Acids bound To D-carnitine: (D)\nThe FFAs are bound to D-carnitine for transportation. The complex \"a fatty acid with D-carnitine\" is then transported from the lumen back to the matrix through the matrix carnitine exporter. In conclusion, the fatty acid is bound to D-carnitine for the purpose of transportation. So, the correct option is (D) carnitine. \n\nRemember, the other options don't have a direct physiological role in transporting fatty acids. They come into play in similar but separate functions within the energy producing cycle, but they don't directly bind to the fatty acid in transit into the mitochondria.\n1) Thiokinase is an enzyme, and its role is in lower organisms where it catalyzes the first step in the glycolysis pathway, converting ATP to ADP + Pi. It's not involved with fatty acids at any level.\n2) Coenzyme A (CoA) is indeed a vital molecule in fatty acid metabolism. It facilitates the condensation of fatty acid chains with intermediates in the citric acid cycle (Kreb\u2019s cycle). However, CoA plays a role in esterification and thioester formation rather than directly transporting fatty acids. Therefore, CoA(B) does not deal with transportation of fatty acids.\n3) Acetyl-CoA is another vital molecule in the cellular respiration process. It is a final product of the citric acid cycle and enters the mitochondrial matrix to produce ATP through electron transport chain. Acetyl-CoA is not responsible for transporting fats here.\n\nSo based on all aforementioned explanations, our reasoning concludes that fatty acids are bound to (D) carnitine for mitochondrial transport. \n\nSo the answer is (D) carnitine.",

            "question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nBased on the article, which of the following statements is the author likely to agree with?\n\n(A) Heart surgery patients who cannot run on treadmills may benefit from sauna use.\n(B) Patients on a diet would benefit from sauna use.\n(C) Salt restriction would be equal to sauna use for hypertensive patients.\n(D) Patients with skin conditions may be cured with sauna use.",
