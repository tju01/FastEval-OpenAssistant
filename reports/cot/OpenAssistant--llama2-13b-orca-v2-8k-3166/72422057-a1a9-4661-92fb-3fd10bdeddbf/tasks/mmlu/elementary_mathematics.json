We have the information that the total cost of 4 tickets (4t) is $112.\n\nSo, our equation is (D) t over 4 = 112; $28\n\nNow we can solve by isolating t.\n\nTo do this, divide both sides of the equation by 4.\n\n(D) t over 4 = 112\n(D) 1/4 t = 112 * 4/4  <=> $1 = $448\n\nBy dividing both sides by 4, we find:\n\n(D) 1/4 t = 112 * 4/4 = 112  <=> t = 448\n\nHowever, we need to find the cost of one ticket. Since 1/4 * 448 equals the total cost of 4 tickets ($112 + 112 + 112 + 112), we convert back to dollars and find the cost of one ticket:\n\n(D) 1/4 t = 112 * 4/4 = $112 * $4 / $4 + 112 * 1/4 + 112 * 1/4 + 112 * 1/4 = 112 * (2 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4)\n(D) 1/4 t = 112 * (2 + 1 + 1/4) = 112 * 5/4 = $52.78\n\nNow, let's convert this to a fraction of a whole:\n\n(D) 1/4 t = 112 * 5/4 = 5 x 28 = 140  <=> t = 2\n\nTherefore, the cost of one ticket is $2.\n\nSo, the correct equation is (A) 4t = 112; $448.
