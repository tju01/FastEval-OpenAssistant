By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

            "model_answer": "Before deciding on the correct answer, let's analyze the information provided in the text. The passage first asserts the importance of peace and the role of Indonesia and other nations in promoting peace and addressing world issues. Given this context, we can eliminate options that don't seem relevant to the time period discussed in the passage.\n\nOptions (A) and (D) refer to later periods of conflict - the Arab-Israeli conflict (immediate start in 1967) and the Vietnam conflict (several phases starting in 1955-1975). Options (B) and (C) pertain to conflicts which occurred during the time period mentioned in the passage.\n\nThe passage does not mention any specific events or timeframes in the text. However, considering the importance of peace and the Indonesian leader Sukarno's approach during the pertinent time period, the text implies that an event that was taking place concurrently with the Bandung Conference would particularly affect the political aims of Indonesia and its allies.\n\nBased on the text, the context of the passage and the information provided, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) the Cold War.\n\nThis is because the passage does not specify a particular conflict but the importance of peace is evident, and the Cold War (derived from tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union) fits naturally into this time period where nations like Indonesia were trying to maintain neutrality. Therefore, it is most likely that Sukarno of the Bandung Conference was most intently focused on managing and preserving peace during this time period, which was the height of the Cold War in the mid-20th century.\n\nThe above analysis leads to the conclusion that Sukarno tried not to take sides or escalate tensions between big powers. The other options either did not exist in the mid-of 20th century, or would not logically be a focal point of Sukarno's efforts in a text focused on the idea that \"No task is more urgent than that of preserving peace.\" Therefore, we can safely conclude that Sukarno was more focused on the Cold War than the described alternatives.\n\nTherefore, the option (C) the Cold War as the time period refers to best fits the explanation, as there is no other information to work with.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) Revolutionary progressivism does not always concern itself with gender equality.\n\nThe reasoning behind this answer is based on the information given in the first passage from Olympe de Gouges and Halima Ghomri. In Olympe de Gouges' \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen\" (1791), she mentions that women receive nothing but more scorn and disdain after the Revolution. Despite some progress in certain areas, like education for children, the overall situation remains stagnant and no advancements have been made in gender equality. \n\nHalima Ghomri's quote, when discussing Algeria's war of independence, indicates that although their children were now able to learn without fear, no other real improvement had shown in their lives. This quote highlights the struggles of women and the ways they may not have received full benefit from revolutionary movements concerned with gender equality. \n\nSo based on this analysis, option (A) Revolutionary progressivism does not always concern itself with gender equality is the best supported observation among the choices given. The other options don't align with the information provided in the passage.\n\n(B) Women typically assume leadership roles during times of revolution is not supported by the first passage, as there is no mention of women capturing leadership roles during revolutionary situations.\n(C) Women rarely support revolutions and therefore receive little benefit from them has some grounding but it is not fully supported because Olympe de Gouges' passage suggests that the generation she is talking about \"women\" received a scorn and disdain from their revolutionary leaders.\n(D) Revolutionary movements are generally uninterested in women's rights also has some grounding, as corresponds with the repression of women's rights in war-torn societies.

The text primarily discusses African exploitation by imperialist systems rather than trading for foodstuffs. \n\n(B) Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms. \nExplanation: Although the statement discusses trading contacts with Europeans, it doesn't mention the specific reason for trading as acquiring firearms to consolidate new states and kingdoms. The statement focuses on the operation of the imperialist system and the responsibility of the agents and accomplices of that system.\n\n(C) Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves. \nExplanation: Although the statement mentions the exploitation of Africa and the capitalists of Western Europe, it does not mention the direct relationship between European merchants and the purchase of slaves.

The German people and government felt that the terms of the treaty were unfair and did not match their country's role in the war. They saw the treaty as a punishment rather than a just settlement, which created feelings of resentment and unhappiness throughout Germany.

This belief contributed to the nationalistic sentiment that informs Hitler's actions in pursuit of a better Germany, including his fervent opposition to the terms set by the Treaty of Versailles.

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\n(A) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\n(B) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n(C) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n(D) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.",
