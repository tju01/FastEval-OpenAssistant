            "question": "Which State ordinarily exercises jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels?\n\n(A) The coastal State\n(B) The flag State\n(C) All States enjoy such jurisdiction\n(D) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "My answer is (B) The flag State.\n\nMy process of arriving at this answer includes the following steps:\n\n1. The question refers to \"crimes committed on board vessels.\" This indicates that the jurisdiction being considered is related to maritime law.\n\n2. There are four answer options provided. We can eliminate the first three options:\n\n(A) The coastal State: Coastal States generally have only limited jurisdiction within their territorial waters, and this question is focused on crimes committed on board vessels, which may be in international waters.\n\n(C) All States enjoy such jurisdiction: This is not correct, as not all states have the authority to exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels.\n\n(D) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea: The Tribunal is primarily concerned with disputes between states, not with individual crimes committed on board vessels.\n\n3. This leaves only one answer option:\n\n(B) The flag State: The flag State is the state that registers the ship and is responsible for its compliance with international law. Under the rule of flag jurisdiction as established by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the flagState has the exclusive jurisdiction to hear cases related to a crime committed by a crew member on board its flagged ship, even if the crime took place in international waters or in the territorial waters of another state. This means that the flag State is the one with jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels.",

            "question": "What is the meaning of justiciability?\n\n(A) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders\n(B) Justiciability refers to the just nature or cause of a particular right\n(C) Justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular rights conforms to principles of justice\n(D) Justiciability refers to the obligation of a State to enforce a particular Right",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is:\n\n(A) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders.\n\nThis answer is correct because justiciability refers to the ability or likelihood of a particular right being successfully enforced through the courts. It doesn't refer to the cause, nature, or assessment of the right itself. Instead, it focuses on the practical part of enforcing the right, which is the jurisdiction of the court.\n\nSo, when courts determine that a right is justiciable, they're saying that the right is legally enforceable, and there is a valid way to resolve the dispute through the legal system. This means that the rights holders have standing to sue and their claim is within the court's jurisdiction.\n\nThe other three answers are incorrect because they focus on different aspects of the right. Answer (B) misinterprets the meaning of justiciability, as it deals with the cause or nature of a right, not its likelihood of enforcement. Answer (C) wrongly characterizes justiciability as an assessment of the courts, rather than a recognition of the right's enforceability. Answer (D) incorrectly claims that justiciability refers to a State's obligation to enforce a right, instead of the practical reality of whether that enforcement is likely or actual.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (A), which deals with the likelihood or possibility of enforcing a particular right by the rights holder. Contrastingly, the other answers are incorrect because they focus on different parts of the right that are not directly related to whether or not it's justiciable in court.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(C) The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources. \n\nThe UK constitution is uncodified, meaning it's not gathered in a single document, such as a constitution like the American one. Rather, it's a mixture of several laws, customs, and practices. These are gathered primarily in the UK's legislative, executive, and judiciary branches. For instance, the Magna Carta from 1215 is one of the most significant early documents of the uncodified UK Constitution. Other sources include the doctrines of parliamentary sovereignty, the principles of the rule of law, and the guarantee of due process. Additionally, the Act of Union 1707 and various statutes, such as the Bill of Rights 1689, are other key sources of the uncodified UK Constitution. Additionally, important political documents like the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the Westminster system, and traditions like the \"parliamentary tradition\" are also crucial.\n\nIn terms of the specific powers of the branches, while the monarch has limited power, those powers are not exhausted merely by the sovereign according to (A). In addition, (B) is incorrect as the judiciary does not have the power to unilaterally overturn acts of parliament. Rather, they can exercise judicial review and, by deciding cases, may invalidate acts of parliament if they are found to be incompatible with the constitution or law. Finally, while the Bill of Rights is an important document, it does not encompass every important feature of the UK Constitution, as it is only one piece of the larger, uncodified puzzle.",

This does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes\n(C) It is a peremptory norm of international law and all States have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute\n(D) It is an obligation which concerns solely international courts and tribunals",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(B)\n\nThe obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes is an obligation of conduct. This means that States have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means, but it does not require them to resolve their disputes. The obligation is based on the premise that peaceful means of dispute resolution are generally preferable to resorting to force or violence. Under the obligation, states are expected to engage in negotiations, mediation, arbitration, and other non-violent means to resolve their disputes. This does not mean that they must always succeed in resolving their disputes, but they must make a good faith effort to do so. peaceful settlement of disputes is an important aspect of international law and is intended to promote stability and peace in the international community. States that fail to comply with this obligation may face criticism and sanctions from the international community.",

            "model_answer": "The most appropriate answer to the question \"Which is a 'rock' under the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)?\" is (C).\n\nThe UNCLOS defines a \"rock\" as an island that is unable to sustain human habitation or economic life of its own and does not have its own Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) or continental shelf. This definition is consistent with the three other answers provided. Answer (A) is an incorrect reference to the size of the island, answer (B) is referring to the maritime zones, and answer (D) is a rephrasing of the definition in answer (C).\n\nrocks under the UNCLOS are also defined by whether they have a high-tide elevation of less than four meters above sea level, which is important as it allows other countries to navigate freely near these rocks. Additionally, rocks under the UNCLOS do not have a right to prevent other countries from fishing or exploring for resources near them, as they are not considered \"territorial sea\" under the law.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Which is a 'rock' under the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)?\" is (C). Rocks are those islands that are unable to support human habitation or economic activity, and are without Exclusive Economic Zones or continental shelves. These rocks are typically small and can be navigated near by other countries without any issue in terms of territorial rights and navigation freedom.",
