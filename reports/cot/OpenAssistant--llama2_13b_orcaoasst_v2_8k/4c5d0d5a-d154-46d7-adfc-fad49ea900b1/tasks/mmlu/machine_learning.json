            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, we must analyze the two statements.\n\nStatement 1: Linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.\n\nThis statement claims that the linear regression estimator has a smaller variance than all other unbiased estimators. This is true because the variance of the linear regression estimator is given by:\n\n\u03c3\u00b2 = (b - a)\u00b2 / N\n\nwhere a and b are the coefficients of a linear regression equation and N is the sample size.\n\nNote that any estimator with a smaller variance than the linear regression estimator must have zero variance, which is not possible for most estimators.\n\n statement 2: The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\n\nThis statement claims that all the weights \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers trained by AdaBoost are non-negative. AdaBoost is a decision tree algorithm that is used for classification problems. The coefficients \u03b1 are assigned to each tree node.\n\nSince AdaBoost is a decision tree algorithm and not a linear regression estimator, we cannot apply statement 1 to it. Also, an AdaBoost classifier does not consist of a single linear model so the linear regression estimator is not the best estimator here either. However, we can show that AdaBoost coefficients \u03b1 are always non-negative.\n\nThis result is because AdaBoost starts with a base learner (usually naive Bayes) which has very poor predictions for all the data points and quickly changes its parameters. The algorithm starts with a small weight on the base learner and gradually increases the weight such that the error is minimized. All the coefficients \u03b1 are non-negative because they are simply added to each other.\n\nThis means that both statements are not related and cannot have a common answer. Therefore, their negations are exclusive.\n\nThe final answer is:\n(A) True, True\n(B) False, False\n(C) True, False\n(D) False, True",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) False, True. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\nStatement 1: Support vector machines (SVMs) are related to logistic regression models in that they produce probability distributions over the possible labels given an input example. However, SVMs use linear kernels, while logistic regression models use non-linear function (usually sigma(x)) as its activation function. Since sigma(x) is a non-linear function, the kernel of logistic regression will not be a linear kernel. Therefore, SVMs and logistic regression models are not interchangeable.\n\nStatement 2: The support vectors of an SVM aren't inherently connected to the choice of kernel function. They're dependent on the magnitude and direction of the support vectors themselves, ignoring the choice of kernel function. Therefore, the support vectors will not change as we move from a linear kernel to a higher order polynomial kernel unless the polynomial kernel consists of all 2nd order terms. If this is the case, then moving from 1st order to 2nd order will cause the support vectors to shift in direction while preserving the same magnitude, while moving from 2nd order to 3rd order will cause a shift in both magnitude and direction, causing new support vectors to be generated. This shift in support vectors will cause changes in decision boundaries, effectively changing the classification of examples that were previously classified using the 1st or 2nd order random hyperplane. In conclusion, as we move from a linear kernel to a higher order polynomial kernel, we cannot expect the support vectors to remain the same for a specific SVM instance.\n\nTogether, these two statements lead to the conclusion that statement 1 is False, which then leads to the inference that statement 2 must also be False.
