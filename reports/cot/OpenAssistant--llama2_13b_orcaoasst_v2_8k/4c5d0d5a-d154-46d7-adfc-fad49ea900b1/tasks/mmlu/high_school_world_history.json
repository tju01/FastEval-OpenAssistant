He urges the peoples of Asia and Africa to use their voice of reason and to mobilize their spiritual, moral, and political strength on the side of peace. By doing so, he is advocating for a world order in which nations are not aligned with specific powers or ideologies, but rather pursue their own interests in a peaceful and cooperative manner. This aligns with the concept of the non-aligned movement, a political movement that grew out of the struggle of colonized countries to achieve independence and maintain their independence in a bipolar world dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union.

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value.

            "model_answer": "The evidence in the passage that Ghanians were engaged, directly or indirectly, in trade with Asia is not explicitly stated. However, we can infer that there was trade between Ghana and Asia based on certain details in the passage.\n\nFirstly, the presence of horses in the king's court suggests that there was likely trade with Central Asia, where horses were particularly valued. The Persian empire, which included present-day Iran, had a strong influence on the region, and horses were an important part of their military. Horseback riding and keeping horses were also significant elements of Persian and Central Asian culture, which implied the influence of trade and cultural exchange.\n\nSecondly, the mention of silk in the passage suggests that there was indirect trade with Asia through intermediary regions. Silk was a highly prized commodity, primarily produced in East and Southeast Asia, and articles made from silk were often used as luxury items or gifts. Silk garments were also worn by the king's court, and gold and jewels were adorned on the king, which were also potentially from abroad.\n\nIn conclusion, while not explicitly stated, the evidence in the passage suggests that there was trade between Ghana and Asia. The presence of horses and silk in the king's court, as well as the adornments of gold and jewels, imply the influence of trade and cultural exchange with Asia.",

He uses the phrase \"it was the best of times, it was the worst of times\" to capture the contrasting aspects of the period.

Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following best explains the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?\n\n(A) Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs.\n(B) Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.\n(C) Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves.\n(D) Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the best explanation for the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E., we can look at the historical evidence provided and analyze the possible implications of these contacts.\n\nFirst, we know that trading contacts between Europeans and Sub-Saharan Africans were established during this period. European merchants, particularly from Portugal, arrived on the African coast in search of goods such as gold, ivory, and slaves. These trade relations had significant economic, cultural, and social implications for both Europeans and Africans.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the options presented:\n\n(A) Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs.\nThis statement suggests that Europeans were the primary source of food for Sub-Saharan Africans. While it's true that Europeans introduced new foodstuffs to Africa, such as maize, sweet potatoes, and mahogany, the availability of these goods did not solely depend on European merchants. Sub-Saharan Africans also traded with other groups, such as Middle Eastern and Indian merchants, for foodstuffs. So this statement is not entirely accurate.\n\n(B) Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.\nThis option suggests that Europeans provided firearms to African states, which helped them consolidate power. While it's true that European firearms were introduced to Africa during this period, and they played a role in the formation and expansion of some African states, the headline of firearms provision alone undersells the complex interplay between socio-political factors and trade in the region. A single factor usually does not drive historical processes.\n\n(C) Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves.\nHere, the premise is that Europeans solely purchased slaves from Sub-Saharan Africa during this period. While it's true that the transatlantic slave trade began in the 16th century and played an important role in shaping African-European interactions, it's not accurate to say that Europeans were the sole purchasers of slaves. The trade was multidirectional, involving various African groups and other regions, such as the Arab world. Additionally, African kingdoms and states also engaged in the slave trade with Europeans, selling captives to other African kingdoms and states as well as to Europeans. So while this option has elements of truth, it oversimplifies the historical reality.\n\n(D) Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty.\nIt's notable that historical evidence indicates Sub-Saharan African groups did form alliances with European powers against the encroaching influence of Muslim and Arab merchants. For instance, the Portuguese established alliances with African kingdoms such as Kongo to gain access to the African interior and counter the influence of the Muslim trading states. Therefore, this option has merit.\n\nIn summary, option D (Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty) best explains the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E. These alliances were an aspect of complex political and social factors that colored the interactions between Europeans, Sub-Saharan Africans, and the wider historical context. Consequently, we can state this option as the most appropriate and accurate among the choices provided.",

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\n(A) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\n(B) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n(C) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n(D) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.",

Therefore, this legitimizes the actions that occurred during the Cawnpore Massacre as a response to the oppressive and dehumanizing British rule. It\u2019s important to note that even though it may be justifiable for the people committing the violence during that time, it still does not make the act any less inhumane or cruel. The consequences of the actions that occurred during the massacre should not be glorified, and empathy for the victims should be prioritized.
