            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To calculate the NPV of this investment, we can use the following formula:\n\nNPV = (FV - C) / (((1 + r)^n - 1))\n\nwhere:\n\nFV = future value of the investment\nr = discount rate\nn = number of periods\nC = initial investment\n\nIn this case, we know that the future value of the investment in year five and year ten is $500 each. So we can write these values as:\n\nFV5 = $500 (year 5)\nFV10 = $500 (year 10)\n\nWe also know that the initial investment is $500. So we can write this as:\n\nC = $500\n\nWe don't know the discount rate, so we'll use a trial and error approach to find the discount rate that makes the NPV equal to 0.\n\nAssuming we set r = 0%, we can calculate FV5 and FV10 as follows:\n\nFV5 = $500 * (1 + 0%)^5 = $500 * 1.0523 = $526.10\nFV10 = $500 * (1 + 0%)^10 = $500 * 1.0523^10 = $567.08\n\nPlugging in these values into the NPV formula, we get:\n\nNPV = (FV5 - C) / (((1 + r)^n - 1)) = ($526.10 - $500) / (((1 + r)^5 - 1)) = $26.10 / (((1 + r)^5 - 1)) = $26.10 / 4.25 = $6.199\n\nSo the NPV is approximately $6.199, which is not among the given options.\n\nLet's try with a trial discount rate of 5%. Using the same approach as before:\n\nAssuming we set r = 5%, we can calculate FV5 and FV10 as follows:\n\nFV5 = $500 * (1 + 5%)^5 = $500 * 1.05265 = $526.33\nFV10 = $500 * (1 + 5%)^10 = $500 * 1.05265^10 = $588.89\n\nPlugging in these values into the NPV formula, we get:\n\nNPV = (FV5 - C) / (((1 + r)^n - 1)) = ($526.33 - $500) / (((1 + 5%)^5 - 1)) = $26.33 / (((1 + 0.05)^5 - 1)) = $26.33 / 4.25 = $6.22\n\nSo the NPV is approximately $6.22, which is closest to option (B) \u2212$27.\n\nLet's try with a trial discount rate of 10%. Using the same approach as before:\n\nAssuming we set r = 10%, we can calculate FV5 and FV10 as follows:\n\nFV5 = $500 * (1 + 10%)^5 = $500 * 1.105 = $552.50\nFV10 = $500 * (1 + 10%)^10 = $500 * 1.105^10 = $603.82\n\nPlugging in these values into the NPV formula, we get:\n\nNPV = (FV5 - C) / (((1 + r)^n - 1)) = ($552.50 - $500) / (((1 + 0.05)^5 - 1)) = $52.5 / (((1 + 0.05)^5 - 1)) = $52.5 / 4.25 = $12.75\n\nSo the NPV is approximately $12.75, which is closest to option (D) $500.\n\nBased on this trial and error approach, the correct answer should be (D) $500, as it is the only option that results in an NPV of approximately zero when using a discount rate of 10%.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The three-year bond is a debt instrument that pays a regular interest income (coupons) of 5% each year.\n\nThe face value of the bond is $100.\n\nThe yield of the bond is 6%, which is the effective annual interest rate before coupons are paid. So the actual interest rate will be a bit lower after coupons are paid.\n\nFirst, we need to find the price of the bond assuming the yield is constant at 6%. We can use the following formula: P = FV (((1 + r)^n \u2013 1) / n), where FV is the face value, r is the yield, and n is the number of years. Plugging in the values we have, we get P = $100 (((1 + 0.0006)^3 \u2013 1) / 3) / 3 = $96.71.\n\nHowever, this assumes the yield of the bond is constant, which we know it isn't because it pays coupons. So, we need to adjust the bond price to account for coupons. We can use the following formula: P = FV (((1 + r)^n \u2013 r^n) / (n(1 + r)^n - r^n)), where FV is the face value, r is the yield, and n is the number of years. Plugging in the values we have, we get P = $100 (((1 + 0.0006)^3 \u2013 0.0006^3) / (3(1 + 0.0006)^3 - 0.0006^3)) = $96.71.\n\nThis price is the same as the price we found in step 2. So the final answer is (C) $96.71.\n\nSince coupons are already accounted for in the price, we don't have to worry about the fact that coupons are due twice a year. So even though the price would change due to coupons, it would not change the answer we found.",

Plugging in those values, we can solve for the amount distributed to all shareholders:\n\n$70,000 = $400,000 x (1 - 4/5)\n$70,000 / $400,000 = (1 - 4/5)\n(1 - 4/5) = 1 - 4/5 = 1 - 8/5 = 7/5\n\nSo, the amount distributed to all shareholders was $70,000 / 5 = $14,000.\n\nNow we need to determine how much of that amount was distributed to Carson.\n\nSince Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock of a C corporation, we can use the following equation to determine how much income was distributed to Carson:\n\nCarson\u2019s distribution = total distributions x percentage owned\n\nWe know that Carson\u2019s distribution was $14,000, the total distributions were $70,000, and Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock. Plugging in those values, we can solve for Carson\u2019s distribution:\n\n$14,000 = $70,000 x 0.4\n$14,000 / $70,000 = 0.4\n\nSo, the amount distributed to Carson was $14,000 x 0.4 = $5,600.\n\nNow we need to determine how much income Carson would have reported on his individual return if the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions had been proportionate.\n\nSince the other shareholders would have received the remaining 60% of the distributions, we can use the following equation to determine how much income the other shareholders would have reported on their individual returns:\n\nothers\u2019 income = total distributions x percentage not owned\n\nWe know that total distributions were $70,000, the corporation had $400,000 in taxable income, and Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock. Plugging in those values, we can solve for the other shareholders\u2019 income:\n\n$70,000 = $400,000 x (1 - percentage not owned)\n$70,000 / $400,000 = (1 - percentage not owned)\n(1 - percentage not owned) = 1 - 60% = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4\n\nSo, the other shareholders would have reported $70,000 x 0.4 = $28,000 in income on their individual returns.\n\nFinally, we can use the following equation to determine how much income Carson would have reported on his individual return if the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions had been proportionate:\n\nCarson\u2019s return = Carson\u2019s distribution x corporate tax rate + other shareholders\u2019 income x (1-corporate tax rate)\n\nWe know that Carson\u2019s distribution was $5,600, the corporate tax rate was 4/5, and the other shareholders\u2019 income was $28,000. Plugging in those values, we can solve for Carson\u2019s return:\n\n$5,600 = $5,600 x 4/5 + $28,000 x ((1 - 4/5) / (1 - 4/5))\n$5,600 / $5,600 = (4/5) + (28,000 / (4/5))\n(4/5) + (28,000 / (4/5)) = 4/5 + (28,000 / 1.8)\n(4/5 + 28,000 / 1.8) = 4/5 + 15,333.33\n4/5 + 15,333.33 = 3.9333\n3.9333 = 4/5 + (28,000 / 1.8 * (1 - (4/5)))\n3.9333 = 4/5 + (28,000 / 1.8 * 0.1)\n3.9333 = 4/5 + (28,000 / 1.8 * (18,000 / 5))\n\nSince 18,000 / 5 = 3,600, we can rewrite the equation as follows:\n\n3.9333 = 4/5 + (28,000 / 1.8 * 3.6)\n3.9333 = 4/5 + (301,250 / 9)\n\nSo, the amount Carson would have reported on his individual return was $160,000. Therefore, the answer is (C) $160,000.",
