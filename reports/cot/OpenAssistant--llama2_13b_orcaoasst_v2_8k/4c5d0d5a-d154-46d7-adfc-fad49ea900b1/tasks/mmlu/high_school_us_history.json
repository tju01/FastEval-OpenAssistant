Option (B) says the U.S. bought it from the Native Americans, but there is no mention of Native Americans in the given text. Option (D) talks about a negotiated treaty with Great Britain, which again is different time period and not mentioned here.

Other elements of the Second New Deal included the Public Works Administration, the Works Progress Administration, and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, among others. The Second New Deal was launched in response to both political challenges like that of Senator Long, as well as economic and social conditions in the country. In particular, it was shaped by concerns about widespread unemployment and poverty in the face of economic collapse during the Great Depression. By addressing these concerns, Roosevelt aimed to build support for his presidency, stabilize the economy, and reduce inequality in the country. The Second New Deal, and Roosevelt's broader policy approach during his presidency, have been the subject of much historical debate and analysis, and their impact on the country's economic and political landscape remains a matter of ongoing discussion.",

This suggests that government corruption was a problem during that time, leading to individuals and entities being oppressed. Furthermore, the mention of the \"old party bosses\" could indicate corruption in the political system, where party bosses influenced political decisions. The song also talks about \"monopolies banded together,\" which relates to big businesses having significant influence on the government. The corruption and governing of the economy by monopolies and party bosses led to public demand for increased popular control and reform of the government.\n\nTherefore, the events and issues in the song reflect the development of corruption in government, especially as it related to big business, and the resulting demand for increased popular control and reform during the late 1800s. It highlights the broader societal issue of corruption in government that influenced the public to demand more representation and reform.

Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared his preference for gradual abolition. However, his racial views changed during the war but were never fully aligned with egalitarian abolitionists.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n(A) The war came to a swift conclusion because the Proclamation made the Confederacy realize the futility of their cause. - This option is not accurate. While the Emancipation Proclamation did weaken the Confederacy's moral and political position, it did not cause them to give up the fight. The war continued for two more years, with the Union ultimately winning due to factors such as economic and military superiority.\n\n(B) The war grew in scope because the Proclamation caused Great Britain to join the fight on the side of the Union. - This option is also not accurate. While there were discussions in Britain about potentially joining the war on the side of the Union, they did not result in formal involvement. Britain remained neutral throughout the conflict.\n\n(C) President Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy vowed massive resistance to any Union effort to free the slaves. - This option is partially true.
