The length of the rectangle is twice its width, so we can write the length as 2w.\n3. The length of the diagonal is given as 5sqrt(5).\n4. We know that the square of the length of the diagonal is equal to the sum of the squares of the length and width of the rectangle, because the square of the length is 4 times the square of the width.\n5. Substitute the length of the diagonal (5sqrt(5)) and the relationship between length and width (2w) into the equation: 5sqrt(5)^2 - 4w^2 = 0.\n6. Solve for w: w^2 - 5sqrt(5)w + 10 = 0.\n7. Find the discriminant of the quadratic equation: b^2 - 4ac = 5sqrt(5) - 16.\n8. The discriminant must be greater than or equal to zero, so the roots must be real numbers. There are two possible real roots for this discriminant: one is w = 1 + 2sqrt(5)/3 and the other is w = 1 - 2sqrt(5)/3.\n9. One root will give the length and the other root will give the width, so we have two possible solutions.\n10.

            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we will start by proving that the power of 2 raised to any whole number less than n is a factor of n. Then, we will test if any other given factors are multiples of 2^n-1 and if so, we know that is the greatest factor of n that is a power of 2. Therefore, we can loop through all the factors of n and check if we can express n as a product of two such factors. If we can do so for some i < j < k, where j is the smallest such index, we take i and j as our current factorization of n and we need to check if both i and j are a multiple of the next largest prime factor p. If so, we append j to the product of the factors, otherwise we take j as a new current factorization for i. This will lead us to the answer by back tracking through all the looped factors.\n\nHaving explained all the steps, let's check if 392 is a powerful number. We can factorize it into two large factors, as follows:\n392 = 2^32 * 3^4. Let's continue with the logic from above using the new factors.\n* For all i in range 0 to 3, 2^i is not a factor of n, because we wrote the assumption for the greatest possible factor of that form as \"or the next largest prime factor p\". Thus, there are no other possible Emilie options, so we back track all the way to i=0.\n* Next, we try for j = 3. 2^j is not a factor, so we backtrack to j=2.\n* Then 2^2 is not a factor for j = 2, so we backtrack all the way to j=1.\n* At this point, we go into a loop: 2^1 and 3^4 both have factors that are comutative into each other, thus they are coprime, so they are two factors of n as initially specified. This means that we found a factorization of n into two parameters i and j, and the next largest factor of n is the smallest factor of 392, which is 3. So, we can take both factors and j as the current highest factorization. 3^2 is a factor but 2^j is not a factor. Therefore, we backtrack to j = 1 and we will continue testing other values for j to ensure we have the best current factorization.\n* j = 0. 2^0 is a factor this time, so we take i and j as our current highest factorization and calculate the next largest factor of n w.rt. to j. It is not a prime factor. j = -1, so we backtrack all the way to j = 0.\n* j = -2. 2^2 is a factor meaning we take i and j as our current highest factorization. the next largest factor of n w.rt. to j is not a factor. j = -3, so we backtrack all the way to j = -2 and we have reached the step of our logic that Back tracking all the way to i=0\n\nTherefore, the next largest factor of n is 3.

This means that $f(1)\\le f(2)$.\n\nOn the interval $(2,3)$, $f(x)$ is decreasing since it lies above the line segment between $(2,5)$ and $(3,9)$ and also because $f(2)\\ge f(1)$.\n\nOn the interval $(3,7)$, we cannot make any conclusion about the monotonicity of $f(x)$ since we do not have enough information.\n\nOn the interval $(7,9)$, $f(x)$ is increasing since it lies below the line segment between $(7,5)$ and $(9,9)$.

            "model_answer": "The number of pins John originally had is 396 pins. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\nJohn divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. Since he had two piles, he must have had an even number of pins to begin with, as he would need two piles to make an even number of pins.\n\nThe two piles had an equal number of pins. This means that the number of pins in each pile was the same.\n\nHe gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. Since one pile had the same number of pins as the other, we can say that each pile had a third of the total number of pins. When John gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile, he gave him half of (one-third of one pile) = (one-third of two piles), and since the two piles had the same number, we can say that the one-third of one pile is the same as the one-third of two piles. Therefore, John gave his brother half of (one-third of two piles) = 2/3 * one-third pile (or 2/3 * one-third * 2 piles), and we can represent this as 2/3 of a pile.\n\nJohn had 66 pins left. Since John had twice the number of pins in the 2/3 pile as the full pile, we can say that he originally had 66/2 = 33 pins more than the 2/3 pile.\n\nHowever, John ultimately had 66 pins left, so we can say that the number of pins John originally had was 66 - 33 = 33 pins more than the 2/3 pile. Since the 2/3 pile was 66/3 or 22 pins, 33 pins more than the 2/3 pile would equal 66/3 + 33 = 99 pins.\n\nSince the answer cannot be a fraction or decimal, we must round up or down to the next whole number. In this case, we can round up to 100 pins, as the difference is small (3 pins) and rounding down would go against the goal of using whole numbers.\n\nTherefore, John originally had 100 pins.

We can do this by solving for $m_1$:\n\n$m_1 = \\frac{((1 - \\frac{m}{2} + k) \\times (m - \\frac{m}{2} + l)) \\times 2 - 1}{2} = \\frac{m}{2} - \\frac{k}{2} + l$.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n$(1 + \\frac{m}{2} \\times (m - \\frac{m}{2} + (\\frac{m}{2} - \\frac{m}{2} + k) \\times (m - \\frac{m}{2} + l)) = (1 + m_1 + k_1)$, where $m_1 + k_1 = m$.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ such that $n^2$ is a factor of $1200$.\n\nWe have:\n\n$n^2 = k^2 \\times m_1 = k^2 \\times \\frac{m}{2} + k^2 \\times \\frac{m}{2} + k^2 \\times l$\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n$n^2 > k^2 + k^2 + k^2 \\times \\frac{m}{2} + k^2 \\times \\frac{m}{2} + k^2 \\times l$.\n\nNow, we can calculate $n^2 - k^2 > k^2 + k^2 + k^2 \\times \\frac{m}{2} + k^2 \\times \\frac{m}{2} + k^2 \\times l$. We can then write $n^2 - k^2$ in the form $(m + k) \\times (m + k + 1)$ by solving for $m + k$. We can then calculate the value of $(m + k)^2$ and write it in the form $(m - k + 1)^2$. We can then calculate the value of $(m - k + 1)^2 - (m - k)^2$ and write it in the form $0^2 + (1 \\times (m_1 + k_1))$.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n$(m_1 + k_1) = (m - k + 1) - \\frac{k}{2} = (m - k + \\frac{1}{2}) - \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, we can calculate the value of $(m_1 + k_1)^2$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ such that $n^2$ is a factor of $1200$:\n\n$\\sum(m + k) = (1 + m_1 + k_1)^2 = \\frac{m^2 + mk}{4} + \\frac{rm}{2} + (r + 1/2)^2 - \\frac{rk}{2} = \\frac{m^2 + mk}{4} + rm + rm - \\frac{rm}{2} - \\frac{rm}{4} + \\frac{r^2}{4} + \\frac{r^2 - 2r}{2} + \\frac{r}{4} + r + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{m^2}{4} + m^2 - \\frac{3m^2}{16} - \\frac{r}{2} + \\frac{r^2}{2} + \\frac{r}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{r}{2} - \\frac{r}{2} = \\frac{m^2}{4} + m^2 - \\frac{r}{2} + \\frac{r}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\leq \\frac{m^2}{4} + m^2 - \\frac{r}{2} + \\frac{r}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{m}{2} - \\frac{m}{4} = \\frac{m^3}{2} - r + \\frac{m}{2} + 1 \\times (m - \\frac{m}{2} + l) \\times \\frac{m}{2} - \\frac{m}{4}$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ such that $n^2$ is a factor of $1200$ is:\n\n$\\sum(m + k) = \\frac{m^3}{2} - r + \\frac{m}{2} + 1 \\times (m - \\frac{m}{2} + l) \\times \\frac{m}{2} - \\frac{m}{4} \\leq \\frac{m^3}{2} + \\frac{m}{2} + \\frac{m}{4} + \\frac{m}{2} + \\frac{m}{4} \\leq \\frac{3}{2} \\times m + \\frac{m}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ such that $n^2$ is a factor of $1200$ is:\n\n$(A) 42$.",

Repeat steps 1-6 for all possible first terms and use trial and error method to find the correct answer.\n\nOur task is now to find the fifth arithmetic sequence of odd integers that sums to 240. Let's use a=3 to start our arithmetic sequence, because this is the only way that we can get a fifth term that is also an odd integer.\n\n   1. Choose first term of sequence. a=3\n   2. Choose common difference for the sequence. d=1\n   3. Calculate 5th term of sequence using first term and common difference. a5=3+3(4)=21\n   4.

Subtract first term from sum to get the equation of the arithmetic sequence. 163-3=160\n\nThe equation 160=3(10)+a has no solutions for a becauseg 160 is not divisible by 3.
