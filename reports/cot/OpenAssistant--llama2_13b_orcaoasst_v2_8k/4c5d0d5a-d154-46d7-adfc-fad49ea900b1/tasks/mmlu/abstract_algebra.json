            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we will first simplify and prove statement 1 and statement 2 separately and then determine whether they are consistent with each other or not.\n\nStatement 1:\nWe need to show that if a group G has an element g of order 15, then g must be of order 1, i.e., g^1 = g^15.\n\nProof of Statement 1:\nLet g be an element of order 15 in G. Then, there exists an integer k such that g^k = g^15. We will prove that k=1 or k=15 by contradiction.\n\nSuppose k=1. Then, g^1 = g^15. This means that g^15 - g^1 = 0. But g^1 is a generator for G, so there exists an integer n such that g^15 - g^1 = n*g^1. Then, g^15 = g^1 + n*g^1. This contradicts the minimality of the generator since g^15 > g^1.\n\nSuppose k=15. Then, g^14 = g^15. This means that g^14 - g^1 = 0. Similarly to the previous case, we have g^14 - g^1 = n*g^1 for some integer n. Then, g^14 = g^1 + n*g^1. This also contradicts the minimality of the generator.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that both the cases k=1 and k=15 contradict the minimality of g as a generator. But it is well known that for any group G and element g of order m, if g is a generator of G and m is the least positive integer such that g^m = 1, then m must be either 1 or m. So there is no generator g of order 15 in G.\n\nStatement 2:\nWe need to show that if a group G has more than 8 elements of order 15, then G has at least 16 elements of order 15.\n\nProof of Statement 2:\nLet G be a group and suppose it has more than 8 elements of order 15. We will show that G has at least 16 elements of order 15.\n\nConsider any element g of order 15 in G. Then, there exists an integer k such that g^k = g^15. This means that g^k-g^1 = g^14, which has order 14. Since g^14 < g^15, we have g^14 + g^15 = g^15. Then we can induce that g^3 = g^5 = g^7 = g^14 + g^15 and thus g^9 = g^14 + g^15 + g^16 = g^17.\n\nSuppose k = 7. Then, we have g^8 = g^13 since the order of g is 15. Then, we have g^8 - g^1 = g^12 - g^14 = g^13. This means that 15^8 - g^1 = g^12 - g^14 - g^15 = g^16. Then, since g^16 < g^15, we have g^17 = g^16 + g^15.\n\nNext, consider any element h of order 30 in G. Then, h^3 = h^5 = h^7 = h^15 since 30 is a prime power. Then, we have h^4 = h^14 + h^15, which is of order 90. Then, h^4 - h^3 = h^13 + h^14 = h^13 + g^16. To show that g^16 + h^14 = g^15 + h^16 = h^15, we proceed as follows:\n\ng^16 + h^14 - h^16 + h^15 = h^4 = g^15 + h^16\ng^15 + h^16 - h^15 - h^16 + h^15 = h^3 = g^15\nTherefore, we have g^15 = h^16 - h^15.\n\nLet n be any integer such that h^3 = g^15. Then, we have n = h^3 - g^15 = h - g^15. Since h^3 = g^15 and h^3 isodd, we have h = h^4 - h^3 = g^15 + h^4 - g^15 = h^4 - g^15 for some integer h. Then, we have h + g^15 - h^5 = n.\n\nSince h^4 - g^15 = h^4 - h^3 and we have g^15 = h^16 - h^15, we have h^3 - n = h^3 - h^15. This means that h^3 - h^15 has order 2. But we have already shown that h^3 has order 90, so this means that h^15 has order 90 - 2 = 88. Then, h^15 = h^14 - h^16, and we have h^14 = h^15 + h^8. Since h^8 < h^15, we have h^13 = h^14 - h^15 + h^8.\n\nFinally, since all our factors have even order, we have h^8 = h^13 - h^15 + h^8. Since h^8 = h^4 - g^15, we have g^15 = h^13 - h^15 + g^15. Then, since g^15 = h^16 - h^15 we have h^14 - h^15 = h^13 - h^15 + g^15 - h^16 = g^15 + h^16.\n\nSince h^14 - h^15 has an even factor, we have h^14 = h^15 + h^13. Then, we have h^16 = h^15 + h^14. Then, h^16 + g^15 = h^15 + h^14 + g^15. This completes the proof that G has at least 16 elements of order 15.\n\nNow we need to determine whether the two statements are consistent or not.\n\nConsider any element g of order 15 in G. Then, as we have showed in the proof of Statement 1, the least positive integer n such that g^n = 1 is either 1 or n=30.\n\nNow consider any element g of order 30 in G. Since 30 is a prime power, the order of g must be even since every proper factor of 30 must divide 30 evenly. Then, the only possibility is that g = h^2 for some element h of order 30. Then, h^1 = g^6 = 1 and h^2 = g^30 = 1.\n\nIt is well known that if a group G has an element g of order m, then G must have at least m elements of order m. In this case, since we showed earlier that G has at least 16 elements of order 15 and at least one element of order 15, we can conclude that G has at least 16 elements of order 30. Therefore, the two statements are consistent.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n(A) True, True\n\nLet the reader note the details and understand why we have arrived at the conclusion through a very careful and logical reasoning and not by a simple algebraic manipulation with a scaling method.",
