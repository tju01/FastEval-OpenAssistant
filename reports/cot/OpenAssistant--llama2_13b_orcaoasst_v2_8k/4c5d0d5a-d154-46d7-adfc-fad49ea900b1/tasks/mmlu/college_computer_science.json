            "model_answer": "The access matrix approach to protection has the difficulty that:\n\n(A) the matrix, if stored directly, is large and can be clumsy to manage\n\nThe access matrix is a 2-dimensional table that shows the permissions that each user or group has for each object in the system. If the matrix is stored directly, it can become very large, especially for complex systems with many users and objects. This can make the matrix difficult to manage, navigate, and update.\n\n(B) it is not capable of expressing complex protection requirements\n\nThe access matrix approach is simple and expressed in Aristotle's style, with predicates and clock (S, T) describing the access rights. It can only describe basic access rights and not complex requirements such as policy-based access control (PBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC). This means that the access matrix approach is often limited in its ability to express complex protection requirements.\n\n(C) deciding whether a process has access to a resource is undecidable\n\nDeciding whether a process has access to a resource using the access matrix approach can sometimes be undecidable. This is because the process may have multiple attributes that affect access rights, and the matrix may not be able to capture all of these attributes. For example, the matrix may not be able to capture the fact that a user is a member of a group that has access to a specific resource.\n\n(D) there is no way to express who has rights to change the access matrix itself\n\nThe access matrix approach does not have a built-in mechanism for expressing who has rights to change the access matrix. In most cases, this is because the access matrix is considered to be an abstract representation of access rights and does not necessarily represent real-world permissions. However, in some cases, it may be important to know who has the authority to change the access matrix, such as in cases where the matrix is used to mediate between different groups of users or organizations.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (A) the matrix, if stored directly, is large and can be clumsy to manage, (B) it is not capable of expressing complex protection requirements and (D) there is no way to express who has rights to change the access matrix itself.",
