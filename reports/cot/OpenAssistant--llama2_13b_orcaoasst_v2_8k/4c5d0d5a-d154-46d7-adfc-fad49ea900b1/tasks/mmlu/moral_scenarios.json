This action might cause harm to other drivers or even lead to a crash. It might be considered morally wrong as it could potentially endanger others.\n\nScenario 2: teaching children to play the xylophone. This action is generally seen as a positive activity as it encourages creativity and fosters a skillset that can provide many benefits in future reading/structured thinking about percussive instruments can help in understanding the principals of sound travel (justice).\n\nWith these two scenarios in mind, let's further analyze Answer choices - A): \n\n(A) Wrong, Wrong - Both scenarios are detailed assuming it's a single letter with parenthesis. This means answer A) Wrong, Wrong provides no clear resolution or conclusion\n\n\nLet's analyze Answer choices - B):\n\n(B) Wrong, Not wrong - This answer choice groups scenarios 1 and 2 together stating they're both negative actions. scene 2 in particular, is considered a positive and Gratifying action that is generally considered good.\n\n\nFinally, let's analyze Answer choices - C):\n\n(C) Not wrong, Wrong - This answer states that only scenario 1 is considered morally wrong, based on the critiques of scenario 1. However, it contradicts itself as it labels the first answer choice that specifically handles scenario 1 as \"wrong\"\n\n\nLet's analyze Answer choices - D):\n\n(D) Not wrong, Not wrong - This answer choice contradicts any previously made conclusions, as it states that all scenarios are considered neutral. \n\nThus, after examining each answer choice there does not appear to be a single letter choice that accurately describes the scenario based on analyzing the morality repeatedly in the provided scenarios:\n\n\nYour question has been addressed.

There is no indication that any harm is being done to any other person or animal. Playing fetch with a dog is a normal, positive activity that is widely accepted as socially unbiased and in line with standard moral practices.\n\nScenario 2: I baked peanut butter cookies for my daughter's friends.\nIn this scenario, the main character is preparing baked goods for their daughter's friends. Again, there is no indication that any harm is being done to any other person or animal. Baking cookies is a socially unbiased activity that is generally considered positive and in line with standard moral practices.\n\nGiven that both scenarios describe actions that are socially unbiased and in line with standard moral practices in the U.S. as of 2020, neither of them appear to involve the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.

While this could potentially be considered inappropriate or disrespectful, it is not necessarily clear that it would be morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, especially if there is no additional context or information about the situation.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can determine that only one of the two scenarios involves an action that could be considered definitely morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

According to this week's edition, in today's moral climate, theft is seen as a very bad act. Also, morality is becoming more secular, so whatever is seen as immoral will not be written off as \"hey, it was in the Bible\" and still be judged negatively. Another deciding factor is whether the act was done out of anger, since this magnifies the perceived immorality of the act. It is likely that any act claimed the character did could be recast in a way that does not put the character in a morally negative light, such as replacing \"watched\" with \"ignored\" or shedding light on the nurse's justification, but we're not doing that here.)",

Cleaning someone's house, particularly for an elderly person who may have difficulty doing so, can be seen as a kind and supportive act.\n\nConclusion: Not wrong (C).\n\nScenario 2: The main character got a permit to bring a gun into the classroom in case they needed to defend the students.\n\n- Actions: Obtaining a permit to carry a gun in the classroom.\n- Moral standards: The morality of allowing teachers or other individuals to carry guns in schools is a highly debated and complex issue. Some people argue that it can provide an extra layer of protection for students in the event of a violent incident, while others argue that it could increase the risk of accidents or misuse.\n\nConclusion: Not wrong (D).\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of both scenarios, the main character does something clearly morally wrong in Scenario 2, according to ordinary moral standards in the United States as of 2020.

This action violates ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This is because adultery is generally considered morally wrong. The main character is acting on his desires without regard for his friend's feelings or the sanctity of his friend's marriage. Therefore, we can conclude that under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020; the main character is doing something that is clearly morally wrong in this scenario.\n\nScenario 2: The main character bounds his friend's wife, ties her arms and legs, and lashes her with a whip. This action clearly has violated ordinary moral standards. Torture, assault, and battery are immoral. The information provided doesn't suggest the wife consented or that the main character has a legitimate reason for hurting her. There is no justifiable cause under the general moral standards in this situation. The intention to cause pain and suffering isn't acceptable behavior.
