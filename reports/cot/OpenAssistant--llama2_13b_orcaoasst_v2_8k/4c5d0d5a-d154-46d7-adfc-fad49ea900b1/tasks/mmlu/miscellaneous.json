            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is: \n\n(C) Dun & Bradstreet, Inc.\n\nReasoning: Dun & Bradstreet has a very good credibility and is an internationally recognized value-oriented business company that is known to maintain a global database of business risk information.This information is widely believed to be accurate so creditors and other interested parties can make more informed decisions with the help of Dun & Bradstreet. They maintain a fellow organization who is responsible for the compilation of this data. Another very prominent organization that provides assets and information on businesses is the System for Award Management (SAM), which collects, organizes, and updates information on various businesses that are active within the United States government contracting system. However, the Dun & Bradstreet has additional information outside of US government contracting, hence they are a better option for the question provided. \n\nThe Retail Merchants Association, the United States Retail Credit Association, and the local chamber of commerce do not meet the requirements of the question compared to Dun & Bradstreet. Dun & Bradstreet is a much more reliable source.",

            "model_answer": "This question describes a comprehension strategy rather than an instructional strategy. It is most closely related to (B) Discipline-based inquiry, which is a type of instructional strategy that is focused on inquiry and often includes elements such as guided reading, modeling, and scaffolding. It helps students understand and apply concepts and strategies by actively engaging with the material. Discipline-based inquiry is likely the best way to describe this instructional strategy.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, let me explain:\n\nWood and most other organic materials will ignite and burn at approximately 451 degrees Fahrenheit. It is commonly called the ignition point of paper.  The ignition point will vary depending on the type and condition of the paper, particle size, and other factors.  The boiling point of water is higher than the normal operating temperature of any home printer at about 212 degrees Fahrenheit, so there is no concern for causing combustion with the water vapor from an inkjet. Toner used in laser printers can reach temperatures well up to 248 degrees Fahrenheit, which is well above the ignition point of paper and could cause combustion.",
