            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation is: (C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.\n\nThis is because the sensory distribution of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is primarily in the lateral thigh and the patient reported having a hematoma in her left thigh. Bleeding into the soft tissues around the nerve can cause compression and subsequent numbness in the affected area. The other options listed do not have a clear causal relationship with the patient\u2019s symptoms. A hematoma within the thigh is more likely to cause compression than any of the other conditions listed.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's go through the information provided step by step:\n\n1. The patient is a 25-year-old gravida 3 para 2 female, which means she is pregnant for the third time and has given birth twice before.\n2. She is admitted to the hospital at 39 weeks' gestation in active labor. This means she is experiencing contractions and her body is preparing to deliver the baby.\n3. She had been having regular contractions every 4 minutes, but is now experiencing only intermittent, weak contractions.\n4. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6 hours. This suggests that her pain is being managed.\n5. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. This means that there is no physical obstruction preventing the baby from being delivered.\n6. The fetal head is engaged, which means it is already in the birth canal.\n7. The membranes are intact, which means the amniotic sac is not ruptured.\n8. The fetal heart tones are normal, which means the baby's heart is beating normally.\n9. The cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated, which means the cervix has thinned and the opening has widened to some degree.\n\nBased on this information, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n(A) Braxton Hicks contractions.\n\nBraxton Hicks contractions are sporadic, irregular contractions that do not lead to labor. They are common in late pregnancy as the body prepares for the actual contractions of labor. The patient is currently experiencing weak, intermittent contractions, which is consistent with Braxton Hicks contractions. The other diagnoses listed do not seem to match the patient's symptoms.",

The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2 months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years. He has been generally healthy. Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3 years. He takes no medications. He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay. Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(B) Cor pulmonale\n\nIn this case, the patient has a heart murmur, left-sided cardiomegaly, and left ventricular hypertrophy which are all characteristic of systolic murmurs indicative of hyperfunction or more commonly known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a thickening of the heart muscle and decreased systolic contractility. One consequence of this condition is an increased blood volume getting pumped into the lungs leading to pulmonary hypertension or secondary hypertension. This is the most pressing concern for this patient and if not addressed may lead to further progression of their heart condition. While the other conditions (atrial fibrillation and systemic hypertension) can result from hyperfunction, they are not as directly linked with the principal feature of this patient's condition as cor pulmonale. Tricuspid valve regurgitation is not relevant to this patient's scenario since it is a complication of several different cardiovascular diseases, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and most commonly arises due to mitral valve disease. However, in this patient's case, echocardiography would be required to determine the etiology of the cardiac murmur, and given that they don't have a prior history of heart disease, it is improbable that this murmur and the hypertrophy are caused by tricuspid valve disease.",

An increase in its concentration could potentially inhibit this process.\n(B) Fatty acid synthesis: Fatty acid synthesis and oxidation are two opposing processes, and an increase in one can lead to a decrease in the other. Since fatty acid oxidation is a possibility, fatty acid synthesis might also be inhibited.\n(C) Gluconeogenesis: Gluconeogenesis is the process of making glucose from non-carbohydrate molecules. Malonyl-CoA is not a significant substrate for this process, so it is less likely to be directly inhibited.\n(D) Glycogenolysis: Glycogenolysis is the breakdown of glycogen (stored energy in humans and animals) into glucose. Malonyl-CoA is not a significant substrate for this process either, so it is also less likely to be directly inhibited.\n\nConsidering the information and the analysis of the options, I would conclude that:\n\n(A) Fatty acid oxidation and (B) Fatty acid synthesis are the most probable processes to be directly inhibited by the increased concentration of malonyl-CoA in the muscle biopsy specimens.\n\nAnswer:\n(A)",

On a 10-point scale, she rates the pain as a 1 to 2. She also has hypertension and major depressive disorder. She has received chemotherapy for 2 years. Current medications also include oxycodone (10 mg twice daily), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/d), and fluoxetine (20 mg/d). She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 66 kg (145 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m2 .

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The most appropriate next step in management is:\n\nB) Assess for suicidal ideation.\n\nAlthough the woman rates her pain as a 1 to 2 out of 10 and has a BMI of 24 kg/m2, which is not typically associated with depression, her crying all the time and the fact that she will not get out of bed are both indicators of a clinically significant depressive disorder, as per the criteria laid out in the DSM-V. And because of this, the next appropriate step is to assess her for suicidal ideation before pursuing other treatments.\nTherapy with medications for depression should only be considered after the severity of depression has been determined to be non life-threatening. And for this assessment to occur, ideally a psychologist or psychiatrist should intervene. No physical or medical tests for depression exist. However, if there is a suspicion of suicidal ideation, an SSRI such as fluoxetine should be prescribed as a form of precaution, under the supervision of a mental health specialist.\nIf the patient does not have suicidal ideation, then assessing the cause of the depression is warranted for proper treatment. The depression likely stems from chronic pain, long-term treatment with oxycodone, and potentially from its side effects.  These side effects include constipation, nausea, confusion, vomiting, and sedation. Furthermore, these side effects of opioids likely compound existing symptoms of her medical conditions. For these reasons, oxycodone dosage should be tapered off and a non-opioid medication such as gabapentin or Tramadol should be introduced for pain management. The BP med and diuretic should be continue on and assessed.  If her K+ levels are not normal, amiloride or spironolactone can be added.\nGiven her health history and current conditions, all her medications should be rechecked. Decongestants, diuretics, beta blocks, opioids, alcohol, and Tylenol should all be rechecked to ensure appropriate dosage and regime.",
