            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we can start by recognizing that the equation 24 = 2p, where p is an unknown value, is a quadratic equation. We can rewrite it in the standard form as:\n\np\u00b2 - 24p + 224 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the discriminant of this quadratic equation to determine the number and type of solutions.\n\nThe discriminant of the equation is given by: b\u00b2 - 4ac\n\nIn this case, we have b\u00b2 = 24 and ac = -1 (since the coefficient of p^2 is -24, and all other coefficients are 0).\n\nSubstituting these values into the discriminant formula, we get:\n\nb\u00b2 - 4ac = 24 - 4(-1) = 22\n\nSince the discriminant is greater than 0, we know that this quadratic equation has two distinct real solutions.\n\nWe can then use the formula for the solutions to the quadratic equation:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nSubstituting the values we obtained earlier, we get:\n\nx = (-24 \u00b1 \u221a(22 - 4(-1))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (-24 \u00b1 sqrt(22 - 4)) / 2\n\nx = (-24 \u00b1 sqrt(22)) / 2\n\nNow, we just need to determine which of the two solutions is p. In order to do this, we can solve both solutions for p, and compare the results.\n\nSubstituting x = (-24 \u00b1 sqrt(22)) / 2 into the original quadratic equation, we get:\n\n2p = (-24 \u00b1 sqrt(22))\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\np = (-24 \u00b1 sqrt(22)) / 2\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\np = (-24 \u00b1 sqrt(22)) / 4\n\nNow we can compare the two solutions we found:\n\nx = (-24 \u00b1 sqrt(22)) / 4\n\nWe can see that these two solutions are the same, and that p = -24 + sqrt(22) is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the value of p in 24 = 2p is:\n\n(A) p = 4\n(B) p = 8\n(C) p = 12\n(D) p = 15\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n(D) p = 15",
