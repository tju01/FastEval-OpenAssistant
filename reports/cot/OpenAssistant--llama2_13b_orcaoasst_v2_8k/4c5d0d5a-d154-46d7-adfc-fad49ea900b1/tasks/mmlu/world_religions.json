            "question": " What can murtis be translated as?\n\n(A) Offerings\n(B) Prayers\n(C) Apparitions\n(D) Idols",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Let's break down each of the answer choices and explain why they are possible translations for the word \"murtis\".\n\n(A) Offerings refers to items or objects that are given or sacrificed as a tribute or gift. In some Hindu and Buddhist traditions, murtis may be considered offerings.\n\n(B) Prayers can be a form of devotion, aspiration, or request addressed to a deity or a higher power. Murtis can also represent prayers as they are often used during rituals and ceremonies to seek blessings or to communicate with higher powers.\n\n(C) Apparitions can refer to a sight or experience of something that is not physically present or visible. In some religious contexts, murtis can be associated with apparitions because they represent a deity or a spiritual force that is believed to have supernatural powers or abilities.\n\n(D) Idols are objects or images that are worshipped or revered as symbols of a deity or divine power. Murtis can be considered idols in the sense that they represent a deity and are often worshipped or revered in religious ceremonies and rituals.\n\nOut of these four answer choices, the most appropriate translation for the word \"murtis\" seems to be \"idols\". It is widely understood that murtis resemble idols, as they are idols or images of gods and goddesses that are usually worshipped or revered in Hinduism and Buddhism. The other three choices, while related to religious practices, do not perfectly capture the essence of the term murtis.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(D) Humanistic Buddhism\n\nReasoning:\n\nHumanistic Buddhism is a philosophical approach within Buddhism that emphasizes the importance of human experience and subjectivity. It focuses on the idea that humans have the potential to realize their true nature and achieve enlightenment through their own efforts and understanding. This approach is closely related to naturalism, which emphasizes the importance of the natural world and the study of natural elements and processes. Naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes are therefore most closely associated with Humanistic Buddhism.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the date of the first Buddhist temple construction in Japan, we can look at several historical records and sources.\n\nAccording to most records, Buddhism was first introduced to Japan in the 4th century CE by monks sent from the Korean kingdom of Baekje. The first recorded temple in Japan, Asuka-dera (now known as Daisen-ji), was established in Osaka around 588 CE. However, some sources indicate that there may have been other temples established prior to Asuka-dera.\n\nAdditionally, there are several archaeological findings that provide some evidence of Buddhist remains in Japan dating back to the 4th century CE. These include the Hoko forests in Hyogo Prefecture, where several carved stone Buddhas were discovered, and the Nanmoku Totei pagoda in Shimane Prefecture, which is thought to date back to the 4th or 5th century CE.\n\nBased on the available records and archaeological evidence, the first Buddhist temple in Japan was likely established in the late 4th or early 5th century CE.\n\nAnswer: (D) 596 CE (This answer has been modified due to new evidence regarding the more likely date of establishment for Asuka-dera temple.",
