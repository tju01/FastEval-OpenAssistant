When connecting a potentiometer in a voltage measuring circuit, the voltage drop across its middle terminal will be a fraction of the voltage across the two end terminals. Hence, the maximum error in voltage measurement using this method is 0.5% of the actual voltage. In comparison, a voltmeter has a maximum error less than 0.1%.

            "model_answer": "The universal gates are the important minimum gate set required for simulation of any other gate. Therefore, the answer would be the set of gates that are able to be simulated using only that set of gates. \n\nThe XOR gate is a universal gate, which means that if we can get a universal set of gates, we must contain one XOR gate. Therefore, from a gate perspective we use (D) NOR, NAND, XNOR to resolve the universal aspect of the set. However, now that we added a logical AND gate, we no longer have a universal set.\n\nWe can remove the AND gate, because it is not a universal gate, (like its NAND counterpart). But in doing so we disregard the simulation possibility of AND. Therefore we can remove a paranthesis since at this point we do not have a universal gate set.\n\nThe solution is (D) as we only have NOR and NAND gates left. But NAND is a universal gate, so we are left with NOR.\n\nThe answer is NOR. Using NAND and XNOR allows us to have 2 simulated gates for our universal set. By removing the NAND gate, we explode the ranks of the universal set, which is why I disregarded the NAND gate, because with XNOR, the NOR gate then becomes a universal set as well.",

Then we can use trigonometry to determine the voltage at the timing resistor based on the load counter emf. After that we can discuss the voltage necessary to gate the thyristor. Finally we'll use the voltage to find the range.\n\n##### Calculate time corresponding to firing angle:\n\nLet's assume that the period for the sinewave is 1 second, then\n\nf = 1/T = 314/1 = 314 s units (Hz)\n\n$$t = arctg(E/I) = arctg(200/400) = arctg(21/2) = 48.8674\u00b0 = 0.9264 radians$$\n\nFrom above the time corresponding to firing angle is approximately 48.8674 degrees.\n\n##### Calculate voltage at timing resistor\n\nThe voltage across the timing resistor, V_t, is given by\n\nV_t = E sin(0.9264)\n\n$$V_t = 200 * sin(0.9264) = 109.62 V$$\n\n\n##### Determine voltage necessary to gate the thyristor\n\nThe voltage necessary to gate the thyristor is the gate threshold - the voltage that triggers the thyristor to start conducting, which for a thyristor is around 2-3 V. However we will consider a general ballpark of 2 V just for this example.\n\n##### Calculate firing angle range\n\nBy given assumptions the firing angle must lie between 0\u00b0 and V_t (or around 109.62 V) as the SCR needs to conduct for enough time for the thyristor to turn off again. Therefore the range of firing angle control is\n\n(A) 0\u00b0 to 109.62\u00b0 or (A) 0\u00b0 to 18.94\u00b0\n\nIt's not too hard to pick out the range among the options provided.\n\nThe range of firing angle control is\n\n(A) 0\u00b0 to 109.62\u00b0 or (A) 0\u00b0 to 18.94\u00b0.\n\n(Answer provided as a single letter, with parenthesis explaining the reasoning)",

The relationship between input and output is represented using mathematical equations. The components of a control system are divided into control sub-systems.\n\nAn input/output (I/O) diagram is a block diagram that shows the relationship between the inputs to a control sub-system and its outputs. It includes some or all of the following components: a data box, a logical box, a decision box, and/or a state box.\n\nA data box is used to represent the input to the control sub-system as data values (e.g. a force) that are transferred into the box.  A decision box is used to represent logical connectivity between the input and output.   A logical box is probably a type of decision box.   A state box stores information about the current state of the system and will have one or more I/O arrows connected to it.  The state box will also typically have a logical box, decision box, and/or another state box connected to it.\n\nThe answer to whether \"A box which tells the effect of inputs on control sub system is known as \n(A) Data Box. \n(B) Logical box. \n(C) Decision box. \n(D) State box.\" is: \n(D). \nState box represents the information needed to make logical or function based decisions.  There is typically 1 for each decision box.  The state box in my view would be the most fitting term for the physical box that represents the actions of a control sub-system.\n\nThe logical box, decision box, and data box certainly can have their own physical representation, however, the name \"state box\" has been in use longer and is the correct ( though not unique) terminology for the answer.   It is more likely universal among engineering teams.\n\nI hope this answers your question.

Because both plates are parallel and have the same distance between them, this efffectively gives the appearance of one plate having twice the surface charge density.
