            "model_answer": "Answer: (B) it is not capable of expressing complex protection requirements. \n\nExplanation: \n\nThe access matrix approach to protection is a method used to determine which resources can be accessed by which processes. The access matrix is a table that lists the resources and their associated access lists. Each access list contains the processes that are allowed to access that resource. The access matrix provides a way to specify resource access policies in a concise and easily modified way. \n\nHowever, the access matrix approach has some limitations. One limitation is that it can be difficult to manage a large access matrix. Storing the access matrix directly can result in a large and clumsy matrix. \n\nThe main limitation of the access matrix approach is that it is not capable of expressing complex protection requirements. The access matrix paradigm assumes that resources can be divided into disjoint sets, and that the access matrix can be updated when a new relationship between processes and resources is discovered or a new resource is introduced. However, this assumption does not hold for all models of distributed systems. \n\nFor example, consider a distributed system in which multiple processes access a shared resource. The access matrix approach would not be able to express the complex relationships between the processes and the resource. In addition, the access matrix would not be able to determine which processes have the right to change the access matrix itself. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) it is not capable of expressing complex protection requirements.",
