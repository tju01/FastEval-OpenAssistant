It takes two arguments, a bitstring to be shifted and the number of places to shift it. In this case, x = 1, so we're shifting 0 (the bit pattern of 1 is 00000001) 3 places to the left. This results in shifting in three 0's on the left, which gives us the bit pattern 0000000011, or 8 in decimal form. Therefore, x << 3 is 8. The answer is (C) 8.",

Therefore, it is highly likely that this consideration will affect the program's ability to handle large data sets.\n\n(B) How many programming statements the program contains: The number of programming statements in a program does not directly impact the processing of large data sets. However, having more statements could potentially lead to code complexity, which could indirectly affect the program's performance when dealing with large data sets.\n\n(C) How much memory the program requires as it runs: The memory requirement of a program is crucial when handling large data sets. More memory is needed to store and process the data efficiently. Therefore, this consideration is highly likely to affect the program's ability to handle larger data sets.\n\n(D) How much storage space the program requires as it runs: The storage space required by a program is not directly related to the processing of large data sets. However, if the program requires a significant amount of storage space, it could potentially affect the available disk space and impact the overall performance of the program.\n\nBased on the analysis, the consideration that is LEAST likely to affect the ability of the program to process larger data sets is (B) How many programming statements the program contains.",

Since a two-digit hexadecimal number consists of 16 possible characters, we need to divide the range of values in hexadecimal representation by the number of characters in the representation.\n\nIn base-10, the largest possible value that can be represented in a two-digit hexadecimal number would be the hexadecimal number that represents the largest value that is within the range of values of the two-digit hexadecimal number.\n\nIn the given problem, we know that the values A, B, C, D, E, and F represent 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, respectively.
