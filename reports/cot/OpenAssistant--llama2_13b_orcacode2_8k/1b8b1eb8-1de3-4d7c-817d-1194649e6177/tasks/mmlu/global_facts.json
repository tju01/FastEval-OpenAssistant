            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what being overweight means. Overweight is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in pounds) by the square of their height (in inches).\n\nTo calculate the percentage of adults aged 18 years or older who were overweight in 2016, we need to know the total number of adults. We also need to know the percentage of adults who were overweight in 2016.\n\nAccording to the National Center for Health Statistics, as of 2016, 71.6% of adults aged 18 years or older were overweight. This means that 71.6% of adults had a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of adults aged 18 years or older who were overweight in 2016 was (D) 80%.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to use the following data:\n\n- The GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 is estimated to be around $1,000 (in 1850 prices, not adjusted for inflation or PPP).\n- The GDP per capita in the United States in 2011 (adjusted for inflation and PPP) is estimated to be around $38,000.\n\nTo adjust for inflation, we can use the GDP deflator, which is a measure of the change in the prices of all goods and services produced in the United States. The GDP deflator in 1850 is estimated to be around 0.85, which means that the prices of goods and services in 1850 were 15% lower than in 2011. To adjust for this, we can multiply the GDP per capita in 1850 by (1/0.85)\n\nTo adjust for PPP, we need to use a PPP exchange rate. The PPP exchange rate is a measure of the relative value of different currencies, taking into account the differences in the prices of goods and services in different countries. The PPP exchange rate for the United States in 2011 is estimated to be around 0.84, which means that the relative value of the United States dollar in PPP terms is 84% of its value in nominal terms. To adjust for this, we can multiply the GDP per capita in 1850 by (1/0.84)\n\nUsing these adjustments, we can calculate the GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 adjusted for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices as follows:\n\nGDP per capita in 1850 adjusted for inflation and PPP = (1/0.85) x (1/0.84) x $1,000 = $0.31\n\nSo the answer is: (A) About $300.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to consider what GDP per capita means. GDP per capita is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country divided by the number of people living in that country. To control for inflation and PPP-adjustment, we need to compare GDP per capita in 2016 to GDP per capita in 1950.\n\nNext, we need to consider the fact that GDP is adjusted for inflation. This means that if the cost of goods and services has increased over time, the GDP has also increased to account for this. Therefore, the GDP in 1950 would not actually be adjusted for inflation, but rather for the prices of goods and services in 1950.\n\nTo account for this, we need to use a price index to adjust the value of the GDP in 1950 to today's prices. This is known as PPP-adjustment. Essentially, we need to compare the actual value of goods and services produced in Japan in 1950 to the value of the same goods and services today, adjusted for inflation and PPP-adjustment.\n\nFinally, we can calculate how much GDP per capita increased from 1950 to 2016 in Japan. The answer is:\n\n(C) by 15 fold",

The question asks about the percentage of the global population that does not have access to safe drinking water.\n2. The most recent data for this is from 2019, according to the United Nations.\n3. The U.N. reports that 2.2 billion people around the world still lack access to safe drinking water.\n4. To calculate the percentage, you divide the number of people without access by the total global population, then multiply by 100.\n5.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to use data to determine what fraction of Brazil's population used the internet in the past three months as of 2017. \n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of people in Brazil as of 2017. According to the World Bank, the estimated population of Brazil in 2017 was 207,877,311.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of people in Brazil who used the internet in the past three months as of 2017. Unfortunately, we do not have this information. However, we can make an educated guess based on the internet penetration rate in Brazil. According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), theinternet penetration rate in Brazil as of 2017 was 67.7%. This means that approximately 67.7% of Brazil's population had access to the internet in 2017.\n\nTo find the fraction of the population that used the internet in the past three months, we need to multiply the total number of people in Brazil by the internet penetration rate. \n\nTotal number of people in Brazil: 207,877,311\nInternet penetration rate in Brazil: 67.7%\n\nNumber of people in Brazil who used the internet in the past three months: 207,877,311 * 0.677 = 138,359,331.67\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the population in Brazil that used the internet in the past three months as of 2017 is approximately 138,359,331.67/207,877,311 = 0.662 or 66.2%.\n\nSince one-third of this number is greater than 0.58 or 58%, the answer is not in option (B). The minimum fraction of the population that used the internet in Brazil in the past three months is not less than 0.58, so the answer is not in option (C).

Therefore, we need to use a rough estimate based on a source such as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) or the World Bank.\n\nAccording to the ITU, as of 2017, India had a population of around 1.3 billion people. This means that out of the total population, only around 100 million people used the internet in the past three months.\n\nTo calculate the fraction of the population that used the internet, we need to divide the number of people who used the internet by the total population, and then multiply by 100.\n\n100 million / 1.3 billion = 0.0769\n\n0.0769 x 100 = 7.69%\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 11%.
