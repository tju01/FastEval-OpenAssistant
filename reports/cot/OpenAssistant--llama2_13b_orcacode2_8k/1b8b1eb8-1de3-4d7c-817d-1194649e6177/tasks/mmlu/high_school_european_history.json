One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the given quote from Voltaire and identify the main ideas expressed in it. \n\nThe quote discusses the cruelty of nature and the tragic consequences of natural disasters like the earthquake in Lisbon. Voltaire reflects upon the suffering of animals, families, and businessmen, emphasizing the helplessness of people in the face of such calamities. He also alludes to the irony of the unharmed Inquisition palace and questions the relevance of religion in such times.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options given:\n\n(A) Many were accomplished scientists, who added important pieces to human understanding of the universe: \nThis option suggests that Enlightenment intellectuals were primarily scientists who contributed to human knowledge. However, the quote from Voltaire does not strongly support this idea since he does not talk about his scientific achievements as an Enlightenment intellectual. Therefore, this option is not the best choice.\n\n(B) They utilized new methods of communicating their ideas, such as salons and inexpensive printed pamphlets: \nThis option suggests that Enlightenment intellectuals developed innovative ways to share their thoughts. The quote does not explicitly mention salons or printed pamphlets as forms of communication. However, it does imply that Voltaire was questioning the relevance of religion, which could suggest a preference for a more tolerant and objective approach in social and cultural issues. This option seems fitting to a certain extent but still falls short of being the best choice.\n\n(C) Most rejected religion altogether and adopted atheism as the only credo of a rational man: \nThis option suggests that most Enlightenment intellectuals were atheists who rejected religion. The quote from Voltaire indeed shows skepticism towards religion and questions its relevance during natural disasters. Therefore, this option aligns with the ideas expressed in the quote and appears to be the most accurate description of Enlightenment intellectuals based on this particular quote.\n\n(D) Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues: \nThis option suggests that Enlightenment intellectuals believed science justified adopting a more tolerant and objective perspective in social and cultural matters. Although the quote from Voltaire mentions the importance of scientific discoveries as a lesson, it does not explicitly state that these discoveries justify a more tolerant approach. Therefore, this option does not fully align with the idea presented in the quote.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best answer is:\n\n(C) Most rejected religion altogether and adopted atheism as the only credo of a rational man.",

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?\n\n(A) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.\n(B) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.\n(C) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.\n(D) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported King Louis's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, while he removed their power.",

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\n\n(A) De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\n(B) Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\n(C) Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\n(D) De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.",
