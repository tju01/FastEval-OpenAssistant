            "model_answer": "To determine the number of times the detector will detect a photon, we need to use the statistical mean and standard deviation of a binomial distribution. Since the detector has a quantum efficiency of 0.1, the probability of detecting a photon is 0.1 and the probability of not detecting a photon is 0.9. When we send 100 photons into the detector, the binomial distribution becomes\n\n{Truncated}\n\nTherefore, the chances of the detector detecting photons are high, and the expected number of items of a certain type is very close to the number of items in the population. Hence, the answer is (A) an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 4.",

            "question": "White light is normally incident on a puddle of water (index of refraction 1.33). A thin (500 nm) layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle. Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is\n\n(A) 500 nm\n(B) 550 nm\n(C) 600 nm\n(D) 650 nm",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine the most strongly reflected wavelength, we need to determine the angle of incidence for each wavelength. The angle of incidence is given by the equation:\n\nsin(theta) = n2/n1\n\nwhere n2 is the index of refraction of the medium the light is exiting, n1 is the index of refraction of the medium the light is entering, and theta is the angle of incidence.\n\nWe know that white light is normally incident on the puddle of water with an index of refraction of 1.33 and a thin layer of oil is on the surface of the puddle with an index of refraction of 1.5.\n\nFor wavelengths that are totally reflected at the water-oil interface, the angle of incidence will be 90 degrees. To find the angle of incidence for each wavelength, we need to rearrange the equation above:\n\ntheta = sin(-1)(n2/n1)\n\nHowever, we know that theophilines are real and complex. For wavelengths that are partially reflected at the water-oil interface, theta will be between 0 and 90 degrees. Since the waves are traveling towards the water surface, the index of refraction of the water will be larger than the index of refraction of the oil. Therefore, the following equation will hold true:\n\nn2/n1 < -1\n\nSince the waves are traveling towards the water surface, we can find the indices of refraction of the water and oil relative to the incident light by using the following equations:\n\nn2 / n1 = cos(theta)\nn3 / n4 = cos(theta')\n\nwhere n2 is the index of refraction of the oil relative to the incident light, n1 is the index of refraction of the water relative to the incident light, n3 is the index of refraction of the water relative to the reflected light, and n4 is the index of refraction of the oil relative to the reflected light. Theophilines are real and complex. For wavelengths that are partially reflected, the index of refraction of the water will be larger than the index of refraction of the oil. Since the waves are traveling towards the water surface, the index of refraction of the water relative to the incident light will be larger than the index of refraction of the oil relative to the incident light. Therefore, the following equation will hold true:\n\nn3/n1 <= 1\n\nSimilarly, since the waves are traveling towards the oil surface, the index of refraction of the oil relative to the incident light will be larger than the index of refraction of the water relative to the incident light. Therefore, the following equation will hold true:\n\nn2/n4 <= 1\n\nNow we can determine the angle of incidence for each wavelength. However, we can also simplify the equation by using the fact that sin(x) = x for small angles. Therefore, we can use the following equations:\n\ncos(x)/sin(x) = (1 + tangents(x))/2\nsin(x)/cos(x) = tangents(x)\n\nwhere tangents(x) is the tangent of x. Theophilines are real and complex. Now we can determine the angle of incidence for each wavelength as follows:\n\ntheta = sin(-1)n2/n1 = cos(theta') + tangents(theta')/2\n\nwhere theophilines are real and complex. Using the equation above, we can determine the angle of incidence for each wavelength as follows:\n\ntheta = cos(theta') + tangents(theta')/2\n\nSince theophilines are real and complex, we can verify that the equation is correct by evaluating it for the given values of the indices of refraction and angles of incidence. We can also use the following equation for other cases where tangents(x) is a constant:\n\ntangents(x) = 0\n\nTherefore, the final line should be:\n\n(C)",

The question is asking which principle or model can explain why the ortho- state of the helium atom has lower energy than the corresponding para- state.\n\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty principle is not relevant to this question because it deals with the uncertainty principle of the position and momentum of an electron, which is not directly related to the energy states of the helium atom.\n\nThe Pauli exclusion principle can be ruled out because it only applies to electrons in an atom, and not to other sub-atomic particles.\n\nThe Bohr model of the atom does not explain the energy states of an atom, but rather it describes the behavior of electrons within the atom. It also does not account for the difference in energy between the para- and ortho- states.\n\nNuclear hyperfine coupling is a subtype of spin-spin coupling, which is a type of interaction between the electron spin and the nucleus of an atom. This interaction can affect the energy states of the atom, but it does not directly explain the difference in energy between the para- and ortho- states of the helium atom.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \n\n(C) The Bohr model of the atom.\n\nThis model describes the electrons of an atom as traveling in concentric shells, or energy levels, around the nucleus. The energy levels are separated by energy gaps, which electrons can jump between to create different energy states. The energy states are described by the electron configuration, which consists of the number of electrons and their arrangement in the energy levels. The energy states of the helium atom can be interpreted in terms of the energy levels and energy gaps in the Bohr model of the atom.
