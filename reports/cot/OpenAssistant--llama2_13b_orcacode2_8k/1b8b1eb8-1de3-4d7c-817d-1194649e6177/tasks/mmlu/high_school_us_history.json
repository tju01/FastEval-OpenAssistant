The quote also mentions that the United States will have a congregation of many Republics, comprising hundreds of happy millions, calling and owning no man master.\n3.

It also talks about how the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 allowed for a more welcoming approach towards immigration. \n\nThe Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 were a set of four laws passed during President John Adams' presidency that targeted immigrants, particularly those from Ireland and France. These laws allowed for the deportation of undesirable aliens, prohibited the spread of false information about the government, and restricted public criticism of the government. These laws are considered examples of nativism as they were based on anti-immigrant sentiment and restriction of free speech. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798.",
