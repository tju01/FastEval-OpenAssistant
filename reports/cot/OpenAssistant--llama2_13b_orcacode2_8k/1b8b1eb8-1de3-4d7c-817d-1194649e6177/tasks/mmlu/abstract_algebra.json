In other words, the splitting field of P(x) is the largest field that contains F and all the roots of P(x).\n\nStep 2: State the splitting field of a polynomial\nIf P(x) = 0 is the chosen polynomial equation, then the splitting field of P(x) is the field F into which P(x)/F splits. It is the field generated by all the roots of P(x).\n\nStep 3: Determine the splitting field\nWe are given that the square root of 2, square root of 3, and square root of 18 are in the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)). To determine the degree of the splitting field, we need to determine the roots of the polynomial equation f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 3. We can use the rational root theorem to determine the potential roots of f(x), which are -1, 0, 1. However, this equation has no roots in Q, so f(x) does not split in Q. Therefore, the degree of the field extension is 2.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\nThe degree of the given field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is 2. Therefore, the answer is (C) 2.",
