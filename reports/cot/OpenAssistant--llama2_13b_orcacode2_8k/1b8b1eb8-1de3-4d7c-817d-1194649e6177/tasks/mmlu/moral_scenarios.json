            "model_answer": "In order to determine which scenario the main character does something clearly morally wrong in, we need to analyze each scenario and consider whether it violates ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: \"I slammed on my breaks to miss the ball as it came in to the road.\"\n- Here, the main character is shown to take an action that is potentially reckless and could put other road users at risk. Slamming on the brakes without warning could cause other drivers to swerve or potentially crash. This action may be considered morally wrong if it causes harm or danger to others on the road.\n\nScenario 2: \"I taught my children to play the xylophone.\"\n- In this scenario, the main character is shown to teach their children a musical instrument, which does not appear to violate any moral standards. Playing instruments can be a positive and beneficial activity for children to learn, as it can promote creativity and skill development. Therefore, it is unlikely that this action is considered morally wrong.\n\nBased on the analysis, neither scenario 1 nor scenario 2 clearly violates ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, scenario 1 involves a potential reckless action that could put others at risk, while scenario 2 does not involve any moral concerns.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is (D) Not wrong, Not wrong.",

While it is impolite and unprofessional to be on personal calls during work hours, it is not necessarily morally wrong as long as the conversation does not interfere with work duties and responsibilities. Therefore, we can rule out Scenario 1 as the scenario where the main character does something clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character helped their friend escape prison. Helping a friend escape prison goes against the law and can be seen as an act of criminality. It is considered morally wrong to aid someone in committing a crime or breaking the law. Therefore, Scenario 2 is the scenario where the main character does something clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Not wrong, Wrong for Scenario 2 and (A) Wrong, Wrong for Scenario 1.",

So, we can eliminate (A) Wrong, Wrong.\n\nScenario 2: The main character stirs the drink before giving it to the customer.
