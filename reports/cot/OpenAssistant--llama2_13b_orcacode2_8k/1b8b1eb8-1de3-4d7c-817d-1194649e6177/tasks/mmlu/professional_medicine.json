            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Based on the information provided, the most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation on the left thigh is complication of the IVC filter placement (option B). \n\nHere's why: \n1. The patient had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. This indicates that she had a serious medical condition that required hospitalization. \n2. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage, which can cause bleeding from the blood vessels in the back of the abdomen. This can lead to complications if not treated promptly. \n3. To prevent further bleeding, temporary discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy suggests that the patient was being treated with blood thinners. \n4. The patient had a hematoma, which is a collection of blood outside the blood vessels. This hematoma was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago, indicating that it was likely caused by the complications associated with the medullary embolism and/or the retroperitoneal hemorrhage. \n5. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed, which is a medical device used to prevent blood clots from traveling to the lungs. However, this can also result in complications, such as filter migration or filter fracture, which can lead to prolonged immobility, bleeding, or even death. \n6. The patient's sensation of tingling and numbness on the left thigh is a decreased sensation that is concerning. The presence of a hematoma on the left thigh suggests that there may be an ongoing issue. \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it is most likely that complications related to the IVC filter placement are causing the patient's decreased sensation on the left thigh.",

            "model_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is (B) lower uterine retraction ring. This is because the contractions are intermittent and weak, and the cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated, indicating that the baby is nearing birth. The lower uterine retraction ring can cause weak contractions and intermittent contractions. The other options are not as likely because they do not fit the symptoms presented in the scenario.",

His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold.

Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3 years. He takes no medications. He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay. Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy.

This can lead to a decrease in the pumping efficiency of the heart's left ventricle. Poor pumping efficiency can cause a backward flow of blood from the left ventricle into the right ventricle, which can cause severe fluid buildup in the lungs and lead to lung congestion, known as cor pulmonale.

            "question": "Six healthy subjects participate in a study of muscle metabolism during which hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia is induced.

The increased malonyl-CoA concentration most likely directly inhibits which of the following processes in these subjects?\n\n(A) Fatty acid oxidation\n(B) Fatty acid synthesis\n(C) Gluconeogenesis\n(D) Glycogenolysis",

            "model_answer": "To solve this question, we need to understand the meaning of malonyl-CoA and how it affects the body. \n\nMalonyl-CoA is a molecule that is involved in the process of fatty acid synthesis. It is produced when acetyl-CoA and carboxyl-CoA combine with malonyl-tRNA. \n\nNow, let's see how this information relates to the question. The question says that hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia are induced in the subjects. This means that there is an increase in blood sugar levels and an increase in insulin levels. \n\nThe question also says that muscle biopsy specimens show an increase in malonyl-CoA concentrations. This is unexpected because malonyl-CoA is involved in fatty acid synthesis, not fatty acid oxidation. \n\nSo, the answer is (B) Fatty acid synthesis.

            "model_answer": "The most likely diagnosis based on the given symptoms and imaging findings is (B) Graves' disease. \n\nThis is because Graves' disease is a condition in which the thyroid gland produces an excess of thyroid hormones, leading to symptoms such as irritability, palpitations, heat intolerance, and weight loss. The 6.8-kg weight loss mentioned in the scenario is also a classic symptom of Graves' disease. The 131I scan shows an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple areas of increased and decreased uptake, which is characteristic of Graves' disease. \n\nDefect in thyroid hormone biosynthesis (option A) is unlikely to be the diagnosis as it is a rare genetic condition that causes hyperthyroidism and other thyroid disorders. Multinodular goiter (option C) is a condition characterized by the presence of multiple nodules in the thyroid gland, but it does not typically cause the symptoms mentioned in the scenario.
