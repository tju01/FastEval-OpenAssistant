            "model_answer": "To find the P-value of this test, we need to first calculate the test statistic. We have obtained a sample mean of x-bar = 299.6 (rounded to one decimal place) and the sample standard deviation is not given in the question. However, the sample mean is close to the population mean of 300. According to the central limit theorem, we can assume that the sample mean is approximately normally distributed with mean 300 and variance 0.00008. \n\nThe P-value can be obtained using the formula P(t > t(1.54)) = 2(1 - (1/nn) * (abs(t)/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - (1/(2n-2)",

            "model_answer": "First, we need to find the cut off mark for 99,000 riders (since we are looking for the time interval associated with 100,000 riders). To find this, we can use the fact that the probability of waiting for more than 35 minutes is the probability of waiting for more than 99,000 riders:\n\nP(X > 99,000) = P(X > (35 minutes + 10 minutes)) = 1 - P(X <=35+10) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSo, the lower cut off mark for 99,000 riders is 35+10 minutes, which is 45 minutes. We also know that the lower cut off mark for 100,000 riders is 35 minutes. So, the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders is:\n\n35 - 45 = 10 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 25.3 to 44.7 minutes.",

It means that the expected value of the variable is the sum of the products of each possible outcome and its corresponding probability.\n\n(D) Approximately 95% of the outcomes will be within two standard deviations of the mean: This statement is true for normal distributions. It states that a large proportion of the values of the random variable will lie within a certain range around the mean.\n\nNow, we need to identify which statement is not true for all discrete random variables. Let's consider the options one by one and mark the ones that do not hold for all discrete random variables:\n\n(A) The possible outcomes must all be numerical: It is not always true because some discrete random variables can have non-numerical outcomes. For example, in a toss of a coin, the possible outcomes are \"heads\" and \"tails,\" but they are not numerical values in the traditional sense.\n\n(B) The possible outcomes must be mutually exclusive: It is true because the outcomes of a discrete random variable must be distinct from each other. There cannot be overlapping or simultaneous occurrences of different outcomes.\n\n(C) The mean (expected value) always equals the sum of the products obtained by multiplying each value by its corresponding probability: It is true because this is a fundamental property of probability theory and applies to all discrete random variables.\n\n(D) Approximately 95% of the outcomes will be within two standard deviations of the mean: It is not necessarily true for all types of discrete random variables. It applies specifically to normal distributions, which are a specific type of probability distribution. Not all discrete random variables follow a normal distribution, so this statement may not hold in general.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that is not true for all discrete random variables is (D) Approximately 95% of the outcomes will be within two standard deviations of the mean.

This statement is incorrect. The fact that a null hypothesis can be rejected at the 10% level does not necessarily mean that it can be rejected at the 5% level. The significance level for hypothesis testing determines the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis, and it should be chosen before conducting the test.\n\n(B) Whether to use a one- or two-sided test should typically be decided before gathering the data. This statement is partially correct. The decision to use a one- or two-sided test should be made prior to conducting the test. However, in some scenarios, the choice of the test type may be determined after the data have been collected.\n\n(C) If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis. This statement is true. When conducting a hypothesis test at the 1% level (commonly known as the 1-tail test), the p-value threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis is set at a significance level of 0.01. In other words, there is a 1% chance that the null hypothesis is rejected if the observed test statistic is extreme enough.\n\n(D) The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis. This statement is incorrect. The power of a test refers to its ability to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. It does not relate to the ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.",
