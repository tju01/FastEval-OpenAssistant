            "model_answer": "Step 1: The first step is to understand the definition of the term \"spiral of silence\".

However, it only focuses on disagreements with close peers or family members and does not encompass disagreements with the majority.\n\nOption D: \"When public relations uses opinion poll results to generate support for a particular issue\" is not related to the spiral of silence and is not a valid definition.\n\nStep 3: Based on our analysis, the best definition of the spiral of silence is:\n\n(C) When people hide their opinions if they are in disagreement with their close peers or family members.\n\nFinal answer: (C)",

Therefore, we need to consider the options provided (A, B, C, and D) and determine which one is not included.\n\nOption A - ingratiation: Ingratiation refers to the act of seeking to win favor or gain approval. It involves making connections or building relationships. It typically focuses on positive or empathetic appeals.\n\nOption B - downplaying: Downplaying involves minimizing or reducing the significance or impact of an event, crisis, or problem. It often involves underplaying the severity or importance to create a sense of normalcy or assurance.\n\nOption C - distancing: Distancing involves creating physical or psychological distance between the audience and the crisis. It involves reassuring the public that the crisis is manageable and that the organization is taking appropriate steps to address it.\n\nOption D - nonexistence: Nonexistence, also known as lack or absence, indicates that something does not exist or is not present. In the context of crisis communication, it is unlikely to be a category because it does not involve any specific strategies or actions related to managing crises.\n\nTherefore, the category that is NOT identified by W.
