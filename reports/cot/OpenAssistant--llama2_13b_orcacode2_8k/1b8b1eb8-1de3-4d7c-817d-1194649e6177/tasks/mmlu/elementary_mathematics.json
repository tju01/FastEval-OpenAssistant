Let's call the cost of one ticket \"t\".\n\nOne way to do this is to use the formula \"total cost = number of items * cost per item\". In this case, we want to find the cost per item (i.e., one ticket), so we can set up the following equation:\n\ntotal cost = number of items * cost per item\n\nPlugging in the given information, we get:\n\n$112 = 4 items * cost per item\n\nNow we want to solve for the cost per item. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n$112/4 = cost per item\n\n3 = cost per item\n\nSo the cost of one ticket is $3 (since the cost per item is 3 and we need 4 tickets in total).\n\nAnswer: t = 3",
