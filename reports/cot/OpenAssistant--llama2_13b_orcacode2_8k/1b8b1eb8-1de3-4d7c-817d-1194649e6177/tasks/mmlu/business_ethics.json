            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer should be (B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious.\n\nAdvertising regulatory bodies suggest that adverts must not encourage unsafe practices (item A), cause unnecessary distress or fear (items B and D), and must not cause serious offense (item D).\n\nItem B is correct as unsafe practices can cause distress or fear. Container A is incorrect as encouraging unnecessary wants is not necessarily harmful. Container C is incorrect as wanting something is a positive emotion and not generally considered harmful or irrelevant. The last stem of the sentence mentions causing offense, so Container C under 3rd item is correct. The correct acronym for distress after D is also \"Fear\", and the first item of the list does not relate to the sentence.",

            "model_answer": "The obligations of workers towards their employer are based on individual contracts and wider employment laws. These obligations are the ___ of workers towards their employer. \n\nThe correct answer is (C) Employer duties. Employer duties are the obligations that employers have towards their employees. These obligations are outlined in employment laws and contracts and include things like providing a safe workplace, paying fair wages, and ensuring that employees have access to benefits and reasonable working hours. \n\nThe other answer options (A) Employee rights and (B) Employer duties do not directly relate to the obligations of workers towards their employer. Employee rights refer to the rights that employees have in relation to their employment, such as the right to fair treatment and reasonable accommodation. Employer duties, on the other hand, refer to the obligations that employers have towards their employees, such as the duty to provide a safe workplace and fair compensation. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Employer duties.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) Work-play balance. \n\nExplanation: \n\n1. The question is asking for the term that describes an employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities. \n\n2. The question mentions that this has become a hotly contested issue in recent years, indicating that the answer is related to the debate around work-life balance. \n\n3. The question does not specifically mention \"work-life balance,\" so we need to consider alternative terms related to this issue. \n\n4. Presenteeism refers to the practice of being physically present at work, but not fully engaged or productive. While it is related to work-life balance, it does not directly address the issue of balancing work and non-work activities. \n\n5. Absenteeism refers to the practice of being absent from work. It is also related to work-life balance, but it does not address the issue of balancing work-related and non-work activities. \n\n6. Work-play balance, on the other hand, is a term that directly addresses the issue of balancing work-related activities and non-work activities. It conveys the idea of finding a balance or ratio between the two. \n\n7. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Work-play balance.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to break it down and analyze each part step-by-step.\n\nFirst, we need to identify what is being talked about in the sentence. The sentence talks about limitations and risks of business-CSO collaborations. These collaborations refer to partnerships or joint efforts between businesses and civil society organizations (CSOs).\n\nNext, we need to identify the specific limitations and risks mentioned. The sentence mentions three categories: \"unfair distribution,\" \"gaining more from the relationship,\" and \"CSOs being ________.\"\n\nTo complete the answer, we need to determine what word fits in the blank to make the sentence grammatically correct and coherent. We can eliminate the first two options, as they do not fit in the sentence correctly. The correct answer is option (D): \"Informational asymmetries, Resources, Co-opted.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is (D) Informational asymmetries, Resources, Co-opted.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the meaning of the question. It is asking for the normative theory that is most similar to corporate profit maximization, despite not being directly prescribed by them. \n\nLooking at the options, we can eliminate (A) hedonistic utilitarianism and (C) The Categorical Imperative since they involve maximizing the overall happiness and well-being of all individuals, not just profit. \n\nThat leaves us with (B) preference utilitarianism and (D) ethics of care. \n\nPreference utilitarianism focuses on creating the most happiness for the greatest number of people, which could include maximizing profits. However, ethics of care is concerned with promoting the well-being and care of individuals, which could include promoting the well-being of employees in a corporation. Therefore, the answer is (D) ethics of care.",

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) The only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders. \n\nExplanation: Milton Friedman believed that businesses should not be responsible for any social or environmental issues, and instead, should only focus on maximizing profits for their shareholders. This is called the \"shareholder theory\" which states that the sole responsibility of businesses is to maximize the value of the shares they sell to their shareholders. Friedman believed that shareholders, rather than other groups, should be the ultimate beneficiaries of the firm's profits and share in its risks. This theory has been criticized for ignoring the interests of other stakeholders, such as employees, customers, the environment, and society at large. However, Friedman argued that these stakeholders are better protected when businesses are focused on maximizing profit for their shareholders.",

Task-related fluidity refers to the ability to work on different tasks as needed.\n\nBased on this understanding, the word that best describes a working practice that involves temporal, spatial, and task-related fluidity is \"flexible\".
