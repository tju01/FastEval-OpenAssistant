            "model_answer": "The United Nations Security Council is made up of 15 members, out of which 5 are permanent members and 10 are non-permanent members. The permanent members are China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These five countries have veto power, which means they can veto any resolution that they disagree with. \n\nHowever, the number of seats, veto power, and the structure of the Security Council have changed over time. The current structure of the Security Council was established in 1965, and it is set to expire in 2026. So, the answer is (D).",

            "model_answer": "The Gulf of Tonkin resolution was a formal declaration of war passed by the United States Congress on August 7, 1964, denouncing North Vietnam for what the resolution called \"openly armed attack against the forces of the United States\" in the Gulf of Tonkin on August 4. \n\nThe significance of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution was that it allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam. The resolution authorized the President \"to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the United States and to prevent any further aggression\" in Vietnam and in Southeast Asia. This authorization was not limited by a set date, but rather was open-ended and allowed the President to continue the war for as long as he deemed necessary. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).",

The answer will be provided in the form of a single letter with parenthesis.\n\nOption (A) - Terrorists - can be considered a nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States, as they are not affiliated with any government and engage in acts of violence against individuals or entities.\n\nOption (B) - Organized crime - can be considered a nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States, as it refers to criminal organizations operating outside of legal boundaries.\n\nOption (C) - Drug traffickers - can be considered a nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States, as they engage in the international distribution of illegal drugs and are not affiliated with any government.\n\nTherefore, the option that is not a nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States is (D) - China. China is a state and not a nonstate actor, and while it may pose threats to the United States through its military capabilities or economic practices, it is not a nonstate actor directly engaging in acts of violence or criminal activity.\n\nSo, the answer is (D) - China.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty is and what agreements were signed between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) is an arms control agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union, and later Russia, beginning in 1991 and implemented in 1994. This treaty aimed to reduce and limit the deployment and testing of long-range nuclear missiles.\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) This option states that the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was the first accord on nuclear weapons signed between the United States and the Soviet Union. While START was indeed an accord related to nuclear weapons, it is not the first one. The statement about it being the first is not accurate.\n\n(B) Option (B) states that the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was the first agreement cutting conventional arms in Europe. However, this is not true either. The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was not focused on cutting conventional arms in Europe.\n\n(C) Option (C) states that the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was the first accord to be rejected by the U.S. Senate. This is also incorrect. The statement mentions the U.S. Senate rejecting the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, but there is no record of such rejection.\n\n(D) Option (D) states that the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty mandated the elimination of many long-range nuclear missiles. This is partially correct. The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty did indeed require the reduction and elimination of certain long-range nuclear missiles. However, it did not mandate the elimination of all such missiles.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) on nuclear weapons signed between the United States and the Soviet Union.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The question asks about the implications of the Cold War for American exceptionalism. American exceptionalism refers to the belief that the United States is unique and superior to other countries in terms of its history, values, and role in the world.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) It ended the influence of American exceptionalism entirely: This option suggests that the Cold War completely eradicated the concept of American exceptionalism. However, this statement is unlikely to be true, as the idea of American exceptionalism persisted long after the Cold War ended. Therefore, we can eliminate this option.\n\n(B) Exceptionalism was enhanced by America's status as the 'leader of the free world': Option B states that the Cold War enhanced American exceptionalism by solidifying the country's position as the leader of the free world. This implies that the Cold War reinforced the belief in American superiority and uniqueness.\n\n(C) The extension of American power globally challenged core assumptions of exceptionalism: Option C suggests that the expansion of American power globally during the Cold War posed a challenge to the core assumptions of American exceptionalism. This implies that the Cold War highlighted the limits and complexities of the United States' influence and impact in the world.\n\n(D) Both b and c: Option D combines both options B and C, suggesting that the Cold War both enhanced American exceptionalism through its status as the leader of the free world and challenged core assumptions of exceptionalism through the extension of American power globally. This option takes into account both positive and negative implications of the Cold War for American exceptionalism.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is (D).",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) A strand of neo-isolationist sentiment. \n\nTo arrive at this answer, we need to analyze the question and the options provided. \n\nThe question asks about the 'New Populism'. This refers to a political movement or ideology that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States. \n\nNow, let's examine the options provided: \n\n(A) A strand of neo-isolationist sentiment: This option suggests that the 'New Populism' was characterized by a desire for isolationism, or a withdrawal from international involvement. This aligns with the historical context of the 'New Populism', as it emerged during a time of intense economic and social change in the United States, and was associated with a desire for reforms that would strengthen the country's sovereignty and protect its economic interests. \n\n(B) A strand of internationalist sentiment: This option suggests that the 'New Populism' was characterized by a desire for internationalism, or a commitment to international cooperation and engagement. This contradicts the historical context of the 'New Populism', as it emerged during a time of nationalist fervor and a rejection of international obligations. \n\n(C) An expression of American cultural superiority: This option suggests that the 'New Populism' was characterized by a belief in the cultural superiority of Americans. This contradicts the historical context of the 'New Populism', as it emerged during a time of social and political upheaval, and was motivated by a desire for change and reform, rather than cultural superiority. \n\n(D) Increased incorporation of public opinion in foreign policy making: This option suggests that the 'New Populism' was characterized by an increased focus on public opinion in the making of foreign policy. While this may be true, it does not capture the defining characteristics of the movement as a whole. \n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is (A) A strand of neo-isolationist sentiment.",

            "model_answer": "(A) The war reduced European population levels below that of the United States: This statement is not logically connected to the question. The war did not cause an increase in the United States' population that would result in a shift of economic power. \n\n(B) The United States seized German resources after the war: This statement is partially correct. The United States did seize some German resources after the war, but it did not shift the economic power from Europe to the United States. \n\n(C) European countries paid the United States for assistance: This statement is also partially correct. The United States did receive some payment from European countries for helping them in the war efforts. However, this payment was not enough to shift the economic power from Europe to the United States. \n\n(D) The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy: This statement is the most accurate answer to the question. During World War I, the United States lent money to European countries, making it a creditor country. At the same time, the war spending by European countries boosted the US economy. This shift in financial power from Europe to the United States, along with other factors, contributed to the American economy becoming the world's largest by the 1980s. \n\nAnswer: (D)",
