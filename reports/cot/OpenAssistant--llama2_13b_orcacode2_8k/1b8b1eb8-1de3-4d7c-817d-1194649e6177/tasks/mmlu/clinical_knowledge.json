            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what key attribute is important for successful marathon running. \n\n(A) Strength: While strength is important for any sport, it is probably not the key attribute for marathon running. Marathon running requires endurance rather than sudden bursts of strength.\n\n(B) Power: Power is not the primary focus in marathon running. Pace and endurance are more critical factors for success in this sport.\n\n(C) Stride length: Stride length is important for running, but it is not the key attribute for marathon running. Marathon running requires endurance and the ability to maintain a consistent pace for long periods of time.\n\n(D) Stamina: Stamina is the ability to sustain an activity for a long time without stopping or becoming fatigued. In the case of marathon running, stamina is the ability to sustain a long-distance run for several hours without stopping. Therefore, stamina is the key attribute for successful marathon running.\n\nThe answer is (D) stamina.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Alright, let's break this down step-by-step.\n\nThe question is asking for the commonest cause of dementia in the UK. Dementia is a condition that affects memory and other cognitive abilities. There are several different types of dementia, but some are more common than others.\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\n\n(A) Alzheimer's disease - Alzheimer's disease is a type of dementia that affects memory and other cognitive abilities. It is caused by the buildup of a protein called beta-amyloid in the brain.\n\n(B) Cerebrovascular (stroke) disease - Cerebrovascular disease refers to conditions that affect blood flow to the brain. Stroke is a type of cerebrovascular disease that occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked, often contributing to dementia.\n\n(C) Lewy body dementia - Lewy body dementia is a type of dementia that affects memory and other cognitive abilities. It is characterized by the buildup of proteins called Lewy bodies in the brain.\n\n(D) HIV infection - HIV is a virus that affects the immune system. It is not directly known to cause dementia, although infections and inflammation associated with HIV may contribute to cognitive decline.\n\nBased on this information, we can eliminate options (D) HIV infection and (C) Lewy body dementia since they are specific types of dementia and not the commonest cause in the UK.\n\nNow, we have two options left: (A) Alzheimer's disease and (B) Cerebrovascular (stroke) disease. Since the question is asking for the commonest cause, we need to consider the overall frequency of these conditions in the UK.\n\nAlzheimer's disease is currently the most common cause of dementia in the UK, with an estimated 850,000 people living with the condition. By comparison, stroke is also a significant contributor to dementia, but it is not the most common cause.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Alzheimer's disease.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what anaphylaxis is and its symptoms. Anaphylaxis is a serious, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur suddenly. The symptoms of anaphylaxis can vary, but they often include swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, difficulty breathing, hives, vomiting, diarrhea, and low blood pressure. \n\nNow, let's go through each option and determine if it is a symptom of anaphylaxis:\n\n(A) Stridor: Stridor is a high-pitched, wheezing sound that is heard when breathing in or out. This is a symptom of anaphylaxis, as it indicates that the airway is narrowing due to swelling.\n\n(B) Bradycardia: Bradycardia is a slow heart rate, typically defined as less than 60 beats per minute. This is not a symptom of anaphylaxis. While bradycardia can be associated with allergic reactions, it is not a direct symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\n(C) Severe wheeze: Severe wheezing is a symptom of anaphylaxis. It indicates that the airways are constricted and making a whistling sound.\n\n(D) Rash: While rash can be a symptom of allergic reactions or anaphylaxis, it is not typically considered as severe as the other symptoms listed. It may be a more mild symptom associated with anaphylaxis.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the answer is (B) Bradycardia, as it is not a symptom of anaphylaxis.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the situation in which closed pouches are applied, we need to consider the information provided. \n\nFirst, we know that closed pouches are being discussed. Closed pouches refer to a type of collecting device that is used to manage bodily fluids or stools. \n\nOption (A) states that the patient has a semi-formed or liquid output. If a patient has a semi-formed or liquid output, it suggests that they have a condition or procedure that requires management of those particular bodily fluids. This could be due to various reasons, such as diarrhea, fistula, or an incontinent sphincter. \n\nOption (B) states that the patient has a colostomy. A colostomy refers to a surgical procedure where a small part of the colon is brought out through an opening in the abdominal wall. In this situation, a closed pouch would likely be used to manage solid and liquid fecal matter. \n\nOption (C) states that the immediate post-operative period is involved. The immediate post-operative period refers to the days following surgery when the patient is still recovering. This timeframe suggests that the patient may require specialized medical care or equipment to manage bodily fluids or solids. \n\nOption (D) states that the patient has a urostomy. A urostomy refers to a surgical procedure where a small part of the bladder is brought out through an opening in the abdominal wall. In this situation, closed pouches would likely be used to manage urine. \n\nComparing the options, it can be concluded that closed pouches can be applied in several situations:\n\n(A) The patient has a semi-formed or liquid output.\n(B) The patient has a colostomy.\n(C) In the immediate post-operative period.\n(D) The patient has a urostomy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: (A) (B) (C) (D)",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer the question, we need to understand the concept of sprinting. Sprinting is a type of exercise where a person runs at a very high speed. During sprinting, the muscles require lots of energy, and the body uses both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism to produce energy. Aerobic metabolism uses oxygen to produce energy, while anaerobic metabolism does not require oxygen. \n\nNow, let's look at the question and the options provided. The question states \"With an increasing number of sprints.\" This means that as the number of sprints increases, something happens. The options are:\n\n(A) anaerobic contribution progressively increases.\n(B) pH of the muscle falls below 6.0.\n(C) blood glucose concentration falls below 3 mmol/L.\n(D) relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases.\n\nTo understand the correct answer, we need to know what happens to the body during sprinting. As more sprints are performed, the body adapts and becomes more efficient at using aerobic metabolism. This is because during sprinting, the muscles require lots of energy, which can only be produced using aerobic metabolism. Therefore, the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases as the number of sprints increases. \n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which of the following is true in diplopia, let's analyze each statement and evaluate its relationship to diplopia.\n\nStatement (A): Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered.\nThis statement suggests that if one eye is covered, diplopia will never occur. However, this is not entirely accurate. While covering one eye can reduce the symptoms of diplopia by blocking the image from the affected eye, it does not completely eliminate the condition. Diplopia can still occur due to misalignment or other factors. Therefore, statement (A) is not entirely true but has some truth to it.\n\nStatement (B): The outer image is always the false image.\nThis statement assumes that diplopia occurs when two images are superimposed, with the outer image being the false one. However, diplopia can occur due to various reasons, including misalignment of the eyes, abnormal astigmatism, or a focusing disorder. The misalignment or focusing issues can cause the outer image to be correct while the inner image is the false one. Hence, statement (B) is not entirely true as the outer image can be the correct image in some cases.\n\nStatement (C): A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards.\nThis statement implies that a fourth nerve palsy, which causes a particular type of diplopia known as duane-radakovich syndrome, is triggered by the patient looking upwards. However, the cause of a fourth nerve palsy is not solely dependent on looking upwards. Multiple factors, such as genetics, trauma, or inflammation, can contribute to its occurrence. Therefore, statement (C) is not entirely true as the reason for a fourth nerve palsy is more complex than just the patient looking upwards.\n\nStatement (D): A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint.\nThis statement suggests that a sixth nerve palsy, a type of diplopia, is characterized by a divergent squint. However, this statement is not entirely accurate. Divergent squint can occur due to other conditions such as normal deviation, refractive errors, or thyroid eye disease. The sixth nerve palsy only causes a \u0433\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0431\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0449\u0435\u043b\u0447\u043a\u0438, also known as gaze-evoked nystagmus, which is specific eye movements triggered by gaze fixation. Therefore, statement (D) is not entirely true but has some truth to it.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is (C) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards (not entirely true). \n\nFinal Answer: (C)",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand how sodium bicarbonate affects the extracellular fluid (ECF) and muscle during exercise. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is an alkaline substance that can increase the pH and buffering capacity of the ECF. This means that if we consume sodium bicarbonate before exercise, it can counteract the acidity that builds up in the muscles during intense exercise.\n\nNow, the question asks whether consuming sodium bicarbonate improves middle distance running performance by elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the ECF, allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle. Or, does it reduce the pH and buffering capacity of the ECF, allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle?\n\nFirst, let's look at option (B): reducing the pH and buffering capacity of the ECF. If we consume sodium bicarbonate, it will increase the pH and buffering capacity of the ECF, which means that hydrogen ions from muscle will be neutralized and not effluxed as quickly. This would actually hinder the performance of the runner, as the decreased efflux of hydrogen ions would reduce the efficiency of energy production.\n\nNow, let's consider option (A): elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the ECF, allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle. This is the correct answer. When we consume sodium bicarbonate before exercise, it increases the pH and buffering capacity of the ECF. As a result, more hydrogen ions excreted by the muscle during exercise can be effluxed from the muscle cells, allowing the runner to experience improved performance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A): elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.",
