            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct option is (B) Satisficing.\n\nSatisficing is the term used to describe a decision-making strategy where the decision-maker is willing to accept an outcome that is \"good enough\" but not necessarily optimal. In the context of negotiations, satisficing is a strategy where both parties are willing to accept an outcome that is acceptable but not necessarily the best outcome possible. This can be beneficial in situations where time, resources or energy are limited.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Satisficing.",

            "model_answer": "The term for the 'rule of thumb' type of bias in decision making is Framing bias. This is a cognitive bias that involves perceiving or interpreting situations and decisions in a way that favors a particular outcome or course of action, often due to the way a problem is presented. It can lead to overestimating the importance of small probabilities or details, and underestimating the importance of larger probabilities or big picture perspectives.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n(A) Framing bias",

            "model_answer": "The term 'transformational leader' refers to a leader who inspires followers to change and improve themselves. To determine which of the given political leaders could not be termed a transformational leader, we need to consider their leadership styles and achievements.\n\nMargaret Thatcher: Thatcher was known for her conservative, free-market policies and her strong personality. During her leadership, she implemented significant economic reforms in the UK, including privatization and deregulation, which had a transformative impact on the country's economy. Therefore, Margaret Thatcher can be considered a transformational leader.\n\nMikhail Gorbachov: Gorbachov was the leader of the Soviet Union during a period of significant political and economic changes. He introduced policies of glasnost (transparency) and perestroika (restructuring), aiming to modernize the Soviet economy and society. These reforms significantly impacted the Soviet Union's political and economic landscape, leading to the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union itself. Therefore, Mikhail Gorbachov can be considered a transformational leader.\n\nNelson Mandela: Nelson Mandela is widely recognized for his leadership in the fight against apartheid in South Africa and his efforts to promote social justice and reconciliation. Mandela's leadership style was characterized by his ability to inspire and motivate people, combined with his emphasis on nonviolent conflict resolution and reconciliation. His influence and legacy have had a transformative impact on the nation of South Africa and the world at large. Therefore, Nelson Mandela can be considered a transformational leader.\n\nBill Clinton: Bill Clinton's presidency was marked by significant economic and social reforms in the United States. He worked towards reducing deficits, promoting trade, and implementing policies aimed at expanding access to healthcare and education. Clinton's leadership style was characterized by his ability to work across party lines and his focus on improving the lives of ordinary people. Therefore, Bill Clinton can be considered a transformational leader.\n\nBased on the analysis of the personalities, policies, and achievements of the given political leaders, it can be concluded that all four leaders\u2014Margaret Thatcher, Mikhail Gorbachov, Nelson Mandela, and Bill Clinton\u2014can be termed transformational leaders. Therefore, none of them fits the description of a leader who cannot be considered a transformational leader.\n\nThe answer is None (no letter is given as it cannot be determined).",

The Gantt chart is named after its inventor, Henry Gantt, who developed the chart in the early 1900s. \n\nThe Gantt chart is commonly used in project management to plan and schedule projects. It consists of a horizontal axis representing time and a vertical axis representing tasks or activities. The chart shows the start and end dates of each task, as well as their duration and status. This type of chart is useful for identifying critical path tasks, finding bottlenecks, and ensuring that the project is on track to meet its objectives.\n\nTo summarize, the answer is (B) Work schedule design.",
