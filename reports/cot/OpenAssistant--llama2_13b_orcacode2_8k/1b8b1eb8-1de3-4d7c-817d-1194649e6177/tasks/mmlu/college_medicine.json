            "question": "A police officer carries out hundreds of traffic stops every year. When his supervisor is reviewing the officer\u2019s records for the past year, he notices that the officer is equally likely to stop people of various genders, ages, and races. However, he is significantly more likely to write tickets for middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes. When confronted with this fact, the officer truthfully states that he has no idea why that is, and that it must simply be a coincidence. Unbeknownst to the officer, this behavior is tied to the fact that these men look like his father, with whom he had an abusive relationship as a child. What psychological framework would directly address the unconscious bias in his behavior? \n\n(A) Behaviorist\n(B) Psychoanalytic\n(C) Cognitive behavioral\n(D) Humanistic",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The psychological framework that would directly address the unconscious bias in the officer's behavior would be (C) Cognitive behavioral therapy. \n\nCognitive behavioral therapy focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. In this case, the officer's behavior is being influenced by unconscious biases that he is not aware of. A cognitive behavioral therapist would help the officer identify these biases and work through them using specific techniques such as cognitive restructuring, exposure therapy, and relaxation techniques. By doing so, the officer can learn to overcome his bias and make more impartial traffic stops.",

The question is asking for the person who set the world record for the mile race in 1886.\n2. The answer choices are (A) R Bannister, (B) S Coe, (C) J DiMaggio, and (D) WG George.\n3. We don't know if any of these people were alive in 1886 or if they were involved in running. Therefore, we need to investigate further.\n4. After some research, we found that Sir Roger Bannister was the first person to run a mile in under four minutes. This historic achievement occurred on May 6, 1954.\n5. So, the answer is not A.\n6. We also noticed that Seb Coe is a former middle distance runner and politician from the UK, but we don't know if he set any world records for running a mile in 1886. So, the answer is not B either.\n7. We could not find any information about Joe DiMaggio setting a world record for a mile race in 1886. Therefore, the answer is not C.\n8. Finally, we noticed that George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. was the inventor of the Ferris wheel, an engineer, and a railroad executive. He was not known for setting any records in running. Hence, the answer is not D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) R Bannister.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to know some basic facts about phosphocreatine resynthesis. Phosphocreatine is a molecule that is broken down during high intensity exercise to produce energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the primary energy currency of the body. The breakdown of phosphocreatine produces creatine and phosphate. The creatine is then used to resynthesize phosphocreatine, which can then be broken down again to produce more ATP.\n\nAfter high intensity exercise, the body's rate of ATP production cannot keep up with the energy demands of the body, and creatine and phosphocreatine levels are depleted. The body then has to rely on glucose and fat for energy, which is less efficient than using phosphocreatine and ATP. The rate at which phosphocreatine can be resynthesized is an important factor in how quickly the body can recover from high intensity exercise.\n\nThe answer to the question is (A) about 10 seconds. This is because after intense exercise, the body's creatine stores are quickly replenished, allowing for the resynthesis of phosphocreatine to occur rapidly. This allows for the body to recover quickly from intense exercise and for proper ATP production to continue.",

            "question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nBased on the article, which of the following statements is the author likely to agree with?\n\n(A) Heart surgery patients who cannot run on treadmills may benefit from sauna use.\n(B) Patients on a diet would benefit from sauna use.\n(C) Salt restriction would be equal to sauna use for hypertensive patients.\n(D) Patients with skin conditions may be cured with sauna use.",
