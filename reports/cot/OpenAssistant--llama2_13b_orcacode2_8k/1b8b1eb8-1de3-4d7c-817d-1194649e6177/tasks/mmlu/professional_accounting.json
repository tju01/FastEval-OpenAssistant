Assets Liabilities\n\n(A) No effect No effect\n(B) No effect Understated\n(C) Understated No effect\n(D) Understated Understated",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. Arno Co. did not record a credit purchase of merchandise made prior to year end: This means that Arno did not include the cost of the merchandise in its financial records for the year.\n\n2. However, the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory: This means that the actual physical merchandise was present in Arno's inventory at the end of the year.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can infer that the cost of the merchandise was not recorded in Arno's financial records, but the merchandise itself was present in its inventory.\n\nNow, let's consider the effect this omission has on Arno's balance sheet at year end.\n\n3. Assets: The cost of the merchandise is an expense for Arno, which would be recorded as an asset. If the merchandise was purchased prior to year end, it should have been included in the company's income statement as an expense.\n\n4. Liabilities: Since the merchandise was purchased prior to year end, it should not have affected Arno's balance sheet in terms of liabilities.\n\nConsidering all the information, we can conclude that the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise had an effect on Arno's balance sheet at year end.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n(B) No effect Understated\n\nExplanation:\nThe cost of the merchandise should have been recorded as an expense in Arno's income statement, which would have reduced its assets. However, since it was not recorded, the assets would be overstated. On the other hand, the omission of the merchandise from the inventory would not affect Arno's liabilities, therefore it is understated in the balance sheet.",

Reviewing the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end helps the auditor to identify any transactions that occurred after the year end and before the statements were finalized.

            "model_answer": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The problem statement mentions two different cash flows - one at year five and the other at year ten. We need to calculate the NPV of the investment project.\n2. NPV is the sum of the present values of all future cash flows, with the appropriate discount rate. In other words, NPV = F / (1+r)^n, where F is the future cash flow, r is the discount rate, n is the time value of money (the number of periods between the cash flow and the present).\n3. We are given the cash flows for year five and year ten, and we are told that they will be $500 each. We are also told the discount rate (r) which is 10%.\n4. We need to calculate the present values of these two cash flows. We can do this by dividing the cash flows by (1+r) because (1+r) takes the present value of the cash flow into account. \n5. For year five, we get (500/ (1+0.10)) = $429.68.\n6. For year ten, we get (500/ (1+0.10))^2 = $369.07.\n7. Now we can calculate the NPV by adding up the present values of the two cash flows: $429.68 + $369.07 = $800.75.\n8. Therefore, the investment project is worth $800.75 in today's dollars.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) $3",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the present value of the bond using the formula for present value, which is:\n\nPresent Value = Future Value / (1 + r)^n\n\nwhere FV is the future value, r is the discount rate (which is the coupon rate + the par value of the bond), n is the number of periods, and P is the present value. \n\nWe have the following information:\n- Future value: not given\n- Discount rate: 6%\n- Number of periods: 3 years (n=3)\n- Par value: $100\n- Coupons: 5%\n\nTo find the present value, we first need to find the future value of the bond. We have two components of the future value: the coupon payments and the par value of the bond. \n\nThe coupon payments are 100*5/100 = $5. We need to discount this by the discount rate (6%). \n\nThe coupon payments are paid at the end of each year, so the present value of the first coupon payment is (1-r) = (1-0.06) = 0.94. The present value of the second coupon payment is the same and the present value of the third coupon payment is the same as well. Therefore, the present value of the coupon payments is 0.94^3 = 0.865. The present value of the future value of the bond is (100+105) = $205.\n\nWe have found the future value of the bond, so now we can find the present value using the formula for present value.\n\nPresent Value = $205 / (1 + 0.06)^3\n\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n\nPresent Value = $199.949\n\nTherefore, the price of the bond is $199.949 rounded to the nearest cent, which is $199.95. Since the question asks for the price as a single letter with parenthesis, we can replace $199.95 with ($199).\n\nAnswer: (D) $97.33",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To solve this question, we need to understand the treatment of assets held for sale under accounting standards. An asset held for sale is a non-current asset. It is classified as current assets if it is expected to be sold within 12 months or less. \n\nSince the company is actively marketing the old building for sale and expects to complete the sale in four months, the building is expected to be sold within 12 months or less. Therefore, it will be classified as a current asset. This means that option (A) is incorrect.\n\nNext, we need to consider the implication of classifying the old building as a current asset. If an asset is classified as a current asset, it is depreciated over its useful life. However, if an asset is expected to be sold within 12 months or less, it is no longer reflected in the balance sheet, and any adjustments made to its value are recorded in the income statement.\n\nSince the company is actively marketing the old building for sale and expects to complete the sale in four months, it will not depreciate the building. This means that option (C) is incorrect.\n\nFinally, we need to consider how the building's value is determined on the balance sheet. The most common approach is to value the building at historical cost. However, if an asset is expected to be sold within 12 months or less, the amount recorded in the balance sheet is the amount expected to be received from the sale. This means that if the building is sold for less than its historical cost, the difference is recorded in the income statement as profit or loss on disposal of the asset.\n\nGiven that the company expects to complete the sale of the old building within four months, the building's value on the balance sheet will be the amount expected to be received from the sale, not its historical cost. This means that option (D) is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement regarding the old building is that it will be valued at historical cost (option D) is incorrect, and they will be valued at the expected amount realized from the sale. So, the final answer is:\n\nThe final answer is (D)",
