            "model_answer": "The responsibility to protect is a set of principles that aim to prevent and protect human beings from genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing. The three main principles are the responsibility to prevent, the responsibility to protect, and the responsibility to rebuild. Therefore, the principle that is not an element of the responsibility to protect is the responsibility to remain sovereign. This principle is not part of the responsibility to protect because it focuses on the sovereignty of a state, rather than the protection of its people. Therefore, the answer is (C).",

So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal.

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which statement could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security, we need to analyze each option and consider the values and beliefs associated with liberalism.\n\n(A) suggests that the global economy interconnections ensure that energy security is dependent on all core powers maintaining the conditions for the energy market to operate. It implies a belief in the importance of economic order and minimizing conflict between major powers over energy reserves. This aligns with the values of liberalism, which prioritizes economic cooperation and preventing conflicts.\n\n(B) predicts that energy scarcity will lead to the emergence of a 'new international energy order' characterized by statism and neo-mercantilism. It suggests that states will compete and potentially resort to conflict over energy reserves. This approach, which promotes competition and potential conflict, goes against the values of liberalism, which prioritizes cooperation and peaceful resolution of conflicts.\n\n(C) highlights the dominant position of capitalist economic elites in the current economic system and the importance of oil in sustaining their power. It suggests that those benefiting from the current order will ensure the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues, prioritizing their position. This perspective aligns with liberal values, as it emphasizes the need for a just distribution of wealth and power, which is often associated with challenging the dominance of economic elites.\n\n(D) predicts a return to a more geopolitically confrontational era, with the possibility of resource wars over energy sources. It suggests that states will compete and eventually conflict over the control of major reserves. This perspective, which promotes conflict and potential wars over energy, goes against the values of liberalism, which prioritizes peace and cooperation.\n\nBased on this analysis, it can be concluded that option (A) is the most likely to be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security.",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

Organized crime is considered a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominantly bilateral, focused on bringing individuals to justice who are seeking to evade justice. \n\nThis answer aligns with the question of how governments have responded to the threat of transnational organized crime post-Cold War. It suggests that state responses have focused on domestic law enforcement, information sharing bilaterally, and bringing individuals to justice. \n\nOption (B) states that the government response to transnational crime focuses on targeting individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves. This answer is not fully aligned with the question, as it does not address the post-Cold War context specifically. \n\nOption (C) states that the US war on drugs has heavily influenced the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach emphasizes bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement, combined with a law enforcement-focused strategy. This answer aligns with the question, as it suggests that the US war on drugs has influenced the government response to TNC post-Cold War. \n\nOption (D) states that the emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror. The approach resulted in the militarization of law enforcement, the use of military technology and intelligence, and military force against TNC. This answer does not align with the question, as it introduces a different context (the Global War on Terror) and suggests a militarized response, which is not directly related to the question. \n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is (A), as it provides a direct and coherent response to the question, discussing state responses to transnational organized crime post-Cold War.",

The correct answer is (C) Security studies has been marked by the gradual \"IR-ification\" of the discipline. \n\nTo explain the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The main disciplinary context for security studies theorizing moved away from political science towards multi-academic interaction from sociology, mathematics, psychology, natural and political sciences, and economics. This means that various disciplines came together to study security studies, which is a good thing for policy development as it allows for a diverse range of perspectives and ideas to be considered.\n\n2. The modification of the role of think tanks is not a problem for policy in the institutionalization of academe-policy interaction. In fact, it can be seen as a positive development as it promotes politicization-resistant theory.\n\n3. The third option does not address the potential problem for policy in the institutionalization of academe-policy interaction. It only describes the evolution of security studies within the disciplinary context of International Relations.\n\n4. The last option describes how the institutional blurring between universities, think tanks, and policy has led to policy mergers at every level. This is not a problem for policy in the institutionalization of academe-policy interaction. It only highlights how different institutions are working together to develop policies. \n\nTherefore, option (C) is the correct answer as it describes the potential problem for policy in the institutionalization of academe-policy interaction, which is the gradual \"IR-ification\" of the discipline. This means that the main disciplinary context for security studies is moving away from political science and becoming one of International Relations' two pillars.

The Washington Consensus was a set of policies adopted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the 1990s and 2000s to promote economic growth and reduce poverty. The 10 steps of the Washington Consensus are:\n\n1. Trade liberalization\n2. Fiscal discipline\n3. Deregulation\n4. Privatization\n5. Social safety net\n6. Competition policy\n7. Intellectual property protection\n8. Environmental sustainability\n9. Institutional reform\n10. Market-friendly government policies\n\nIn summary, we have four options: Fiscal Discipline, Tax Reform, Property Rights, and Nationalization. We know that Fiscal Discipline is one of the 10 steps of the Washington Consensus, as it involves budget deficits of no more than 2 per cent of GDP. We know that Tax Reform is also one of the steps, as it involves broadening the tax base, cutting marginal tax rates, and improving tax administration. We know that Property Rights is one of the steps, as legal reforms are used to secure property rights without excessive costs and to regularize the informal sector.\n\nThis leaves us with Nationalization, which does not appear in the 10 steps of the Washington Consensus. It involves protecting state enterprises, which is not a policy that was endorsed by the IMF and other institutions that developed the Washington Consensus.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Nationalization.",
