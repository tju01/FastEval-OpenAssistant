Each attribute (x, y, z, w) represents a different characteristic or property of the object being classified. \n\nThe possible combinations of marbles in the bag are the examples we need to consider. Each possible combination represents an example that can be classified into one of the three classes (A, B, or C) based on the attribute values. \n\nTo find the maximum possible number of different examples, we need to count the number of possible combinations of marbles that can be made. \n\nThe total number of combinations can be calculated using the formula: (n choose r) = n rust mm, where n is the total number of objects (in this case, the number of marbles), r is the number of objects to be chosen randomly from n (in this case, the number of attributes), and m is the total number of unique classes or outcomes (in this case, the number of values in each attribute). \n\nIn this problem, we have n = 4 (number of marbles), r = 3 (number of attributes), m = 3 (number of classes), and each attribute has 2 possible values each. \n\nTherefore, the total number of possible combinations is: (4 choose 3) = 4C3 = 4*3*1 = 24. \n\nSo, the final answer is (B) 24.",

High-resolution typically refers to images with a lot of detail and fine texture. This means that the image contains a lot of pixels and is complex.\n\nNext, let's consider which architecture would be best suited for handling complex, high-resolution images. \n\nA convolutional network is a type of neural network architecture that excels in processing complex images with high levels of detail. It is designed to work with images and can extract features that are useful for classification tasks. \n\nA graph network is a type of neural network that is designed for processing graph-structured data, such as social networks. While it can handle complex data, it is not specifically designed for high-resolution image classification.\n\nA fully connected network is a neural network architecture where all nodes are directly connected to every other node. It is not a specialized architecture for image classification.\n\nRBF networks refer to the radial basis function networks, which are a type of artificial neural network that are designed for use in pattern recognition tasks.

This maximization happens through successive iterations, where the algorithm tries to find the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters. Thus, the log-likelihood of the data will always increase through successive iterations of the expectation maximization algorithm.\n- The second statement is false. Q-learning is an algorithm used in reinforcement learning, where the learner learns to choose the best action by maximizing the expected sum of rewards over time. Q-learning does not require prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment, but rather learned through trial and error based on the feedback it receives.

It does not increase with the increase in dimensionality of the variables or the number of layers in the network. Therefore, the cost of one gradient descent update is proportional to N.\n\nStep 2: The dimensionality of each variable (D) is directly proportional to the number of features in the data (to learn) and the number of layers in the network. It can also increase if the variables are state-dependent or if they are part of a neural network. Therefore, the cost of one gradient descent update is proportional to D.\n\nStep 3: Since the cost is directly proportional to the product of N and D, we can conclude that the cost of one gradient descent update is proportional to ND.
