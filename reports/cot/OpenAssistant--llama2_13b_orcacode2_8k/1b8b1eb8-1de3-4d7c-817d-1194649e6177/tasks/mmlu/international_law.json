            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The State that normally exercises jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels is known as the coastal State (A). This is because the coastal State has the right to establish the legal status of the vessel and to define the jurisdiction and responsibilities of the State in regard to the vessel, its flag, master, officers, and crew, as well as any disputes concerning cargo, passengers, or the ship's documents (Article 37, Law of the Sea Convention). \n\nThe flag State is responsible for the safety and security of its vessel and is responsible for issuing the flag of the vessel and regaining control over it if it is used for a purpose not approved by the flag State (Article 65, Law of the Sea Convention). \n\nAll States enjoy the jurisdiction to take any measures necessary to ensure that persons responsible for crimes committed on board vessels shall be afforded a fair trial in accordance with the law (Article 109, Law of the Sea Convention). \n\nThe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea is a judicial body that can adjudicate disputes regarding the interpretation and application of the Law of the Sea Convention, but it does not have jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels (Article 16, Law of the Sea Convention). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) the coastal State.",

            "model_answer": "The meaning of justiciability can be understood by breaking it down into its components: \"just\" and \"iciable\". \"Just\" refers to something that is fair, right, or justified, while \"iciable\" refers to the ability to be enforced or made enforceable through legal action. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular right conforms to principles of justice. This means that if a right is not being enforced, the court must determine whether this non-enforcement is in accordance with principles of justice, i.e., fairness and equality.",

The question asks about the Lotus principle.\n2. We need to choose the correct definition from the given options.\n3. Option (A) mentions that 'restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed', which is not directly related to the Lotus principle.\n4. Option (B) states that States are free to choose the Court that they will submit their disputes, which aligns with the Lotus principle.\n5. The Lotus principle is often interpreted to mean that States are free to make their own choices about submitting disputes to the International Court of Justice or other forums for settlement.\n6.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze each statement to determine which one is false.\n\n(A) Protocol 14 changed the committee that hears admissibility cases from a three judge to a one judge formation.\n- This statement implies that Protocol 14 made a change in the formation of the committee that hears admissibility cases. It states that the committee was previously a three-judge formation, but with Protocol 14, it became a one-judge formation.\n\n(B) Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility.\n- This statement suggests that Protocol 14 introduced a new requirement or condition for cases to be considered admissible by the European Court of Human Rights. This implies that prior to Protocol 14, there were already existing criteria for admissibility, and Protocol 14 added an additional one.\n\n(C) Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights.\n- This statement claims that Protocol 14 dissolved or terminated the Commission of Human Rights. This implies that prior to Protocol 14, there was a commission or organization called \"Commission of Human Rights,\" but with the implementation of Protocol 14, this commission was abolished or no longer existed.\n\n(D) Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights.\n- This statement suggests that Protocol 14 increased the duration or period of time for which judges serve in the European Court of Human Rights. It implies that prior to Protocol 14, judges had a different term of office, and with the implementation of Protocol 14, their terms were extended.\n\nNow, based on the analysis of each statement, we can determine which one is false. \n\nThe answer is (C) Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights. This statement is incorrect because the Commission of Human Rights did not exist prior to the creation of the European Court of Human Rights. The Commission of Human Rights was actually the original body, and Protocol 14 abolished it and established the European Court of Human Rights. Therefore, the false statement is (C).\n\nAnswer: (C) is false.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer to the question \"What is the meaning of international legal personality?\" is (B).\n\nTo arrive at this answer, we need to understand the meaning of the term \"international legal personality\" and the correct definitions of the options given.\n\nOption (A) states that international legal personality is limited to States. While States are recognized as subjects of international law, this option is not fully accurate as other entities such as international organizations, some international courts, and even individuals can also have international legal personality. Therefore, option (A) is not the correct answer.\n\nOption (B) is the correct answer as it accurately defines international legal personality. International legal personality refers to having rights and duties under international law, which means that an entity has the ability to engage in legal activities and relationships under international law. This includes the capacity to maintain legal rights and obligations and to sue or be sued in international courts or tribunals.\n\nOption (C) suggests that international legal personality implies the challenge of State authority. This is not entirely accurate as the concept of international legal personality is not necessarily linked to challenging State authority. It focuses on the recognition and ascription of legal rights and liabilities under international law.\n\nOption (D) suggests that international legal personality refers to a term used to denote legal persons under international law, as opposed to physical persons. While this is partially true, it does not fully capture the essence of the concept. International legal personality encompasses more than just the distinction between legal and physical persons. It encompasses the ability to engage in legal activities and relationships under international law.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question \"What is the meaning of international legal personality?\" is option (B) - the ability to have rights and duties under international law and the capacity to enforce them.",
