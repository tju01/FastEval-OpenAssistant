            "model_answer": "The correct adjective order is determined by the noun that the adjective describes. In this case, the noun is \"chair\". Therefore, we need to determine the correct adjective order for the word \"chair\".\n\nThe general rule for adjective order is as follows:\n1. Colour/Size/Shape adjectives (e.g. big, small, tall, thin)\n2. Physical state adjectives (e.g. hot, cold, wet)\n3. Age adjectives (e.g. old, young)\n4. Opinion adjectives (e.g. beautiful, ugly)\n5. Purpose adjectives (e.g. good, well, bad)\n6. Proper adjectives (e.g. American, English)\n\nLet's apply this rule to the sentence:\n- \"New\" is not a colour/size/shape adjective, nor is it a physical state adjective, nor is it an age adjective, and it is not an opinion adjective, so it must be a purpose adjective. In this case, \"new\" describes the chair itself, so it should come after the noun. Therefore, the correct sentence is (B) big new triangular American leather chair.\n\nSo the final answer is:",

            "model_answer": "To determine which sentence has the correct adjective order, we need to follow the rules of adjective order in English grammar. The basic rule is that adjectives come before the noun they modify. However, there are also certain rules for placing adjectives that modify more than one noun. \n\nIn sentence (A), we have adjectives modifying multiple nouns: \"rectangular silver ancient green ridiculous big knife.\" The adjectives \"ridiculous big\" modify the noun \"knife,\" while the other adjectives modify its various parts. This sentence follows the basic rule of adjective order, as all the adjectives are placed before the nouns they modify. \n\nIn sentence (B), we have the adjective \"ridiculous\" coming after the noun \"big,\" which does not follow the basic rule of adjective order. Therefore, sentence (B) has the incorrect adjective order. \n\nConclusion: The sentence with the correct adjective order is (A) \"rectangular silver ancient green ridiculous big knife.\"",
