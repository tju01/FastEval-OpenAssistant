We need to find the time window between which Susan could have gone to the coffee shop. \n\nLinda saw Susan driving from 7am to 11am. This means Susan could have gone to the coffee shop between 7am and 11am. But John saw Susan buying clothes from 11am to 12pm, which means Susan could not have gone to the coffee shop between 11am and 12pm. \n\nJessica saw Susan taking photos from 12pm to 1pm, which means Susan could have gone to the coffee shop between 1pm and 2pm. But Steven saw Susan buying lunch from 1pm to 2pm, which means Susan could not have gone to the coffee shop between 1pm and 2pm. \n\nThomas saw Susan reading at the library from 2pm to 6pm, which means Susan could have gone to the coffee shop between 2pm and 6pm. However, the coffee shop was closed after 9pm. Therefore, Susan could not have gone to the coffee shop after 6pm. \n\nSo, Susan could have gone to the coffee shop between 7am and 4pm (best guess) or between 7am and 2pm (marginally better guess). However, since we are looking for the most accurate answer, we should choose the option that is most accurate. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 1pm to 2pm.",

Emily woke up at 10 am, which suggests that she had already left the soccer field before 10 am. Therefore, the time range between 10 am and Linda witnessing Emily at the train station (from 10 am to 12 pm) is unlikely.\n\n2. Let's consider the time between 1 pm and John witnessing Emily at the Statue of Liberty (from 1 pm to 2 pm). We know that John saw Emily during that time. Since Emily would already have arrived at the Statue of Liberty before 1 pm, she must have passed the soccer field before 1 pm. Therefore, the time range between 1 pm and 2 pm is also unlikely.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the possibility of Emily visiting the soccer field during a time outside of the known range. Before 10 am, Emily was likely still in her home or not specified to be at the soccer field. After 2 pm and before 8 pm, the soccer field is closed. Hence, the possible time window for Emily to have gone to the soccer field is between 2 pm and Linda witnessing Emily at the train station.\n\n4.
