Therefore, we need to add 1 to the day of Christmas Eve to get the corresponding date of tomorrow throughout the year. \n\nSince there are 12 days between Christmas Eve and the day after Christmas Eve, we need to add 1 to the day number of Christmas Eve (24) and then subtract the day number of Christmas (25) to get the total days between the two dates. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 12/25/1937 (assuming that the question is specifically about the date of Christmas, even though Christmas Eve has already passed). The total days between Christmas Eve and the day after Christmas Eve is 24 + 1 - 25 = 1. \n\nHence, the answer is: (B) 12/25/1937",
