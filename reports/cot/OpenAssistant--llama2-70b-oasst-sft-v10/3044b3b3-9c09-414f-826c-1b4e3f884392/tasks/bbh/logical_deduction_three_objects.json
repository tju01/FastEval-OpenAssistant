So, option A is not correct.\n\n(B) The apples are the cheapest:\nThis option also contradicts statement 2, since it suggests that the apples are the cheapest, which is not the case according to the given information. So, option B is not correct.\n\n(C) The loquats are the cheapest:\nThis option aligns with statement 2, which states that the loquats are the cheapest. Additionally, since the plums are less expensive than the apples, and the loquats are the cheapest, it means that the apples must be the most expensive. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: (C) The loquats are the cheapest",
