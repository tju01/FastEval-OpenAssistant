            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what a Robertsonian translocation is.\n\nA Robertsonian translocation is a type of chromosome rearrangement in which the long arms of two acrocentric chromosomes (chromosomes with a single centromere located at one end) are joined together at their telomeres, resulting in the formation of a single chromosome with two centromeres.\n\nNow, let's examine each of the answer choices:\n\n(A) Telomeres - Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences that are located at the ends of chromosomes and protect them from damage. In Robertsonian translocations, fusion occurs at the telomeres of the long arms of the acrocentric chromosomes.\n\n(B) Centromeres - Centromeres are regions of DNA that are located in the middle of each chromosome and are responsible for attaching spindle fibers during cell division. While centromeres are involved in the process of Robertsonian translocation, fusion does not occur at the centromeres themselves.\n\n(C) Histones - Histones are proteins that are involved in the structure and packing of DNA in chromosomes. While histones play a role in maintaining chromosome structure, they are not the site of fusion in Robertsonian translocations.\n\n(D) Ends of the long arms - This answer is very close to the correct answer, but it is less specific than option (A).\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n(A) telomeres.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first examine each of the options and see which one matches the characteristics of zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins.\n\n(A) types of DNA-binding proteins\nZinc finger proteins are known to bind to specific sequences of DNA and can act as transcription factors, regulating gene expression. Helix-turn-helix proteins, such as repressor proteins, also bind to specific sequences of DNA and help control gene expression by blocking or enhancing the transcription process. Therefore, both zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins are DNA-binding proteins.\n\n(B) involved in the control of translation\nTranslation involves the synthesis of proteins from the mRNA template, a process that is primarily carried out by ribosomes. Although zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins can influence gene expression, they are not directly involved in the translation process itself.\n\n(C) components of ribosomes\nRibosomes are complex molecular machines made up of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and proteins. They are not composed of specific types of DNA-binding proteins like zinc finger proteins or helix-turn-helix proteins.\n\n(D) part of the hemoglobin in blood cells\nHemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells and is responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body. It is not a DNA-binding protein, nor is it related to zinc finger proteins or helix-turn-helix proteins.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) types of DNA-binding proteins\n\nSo the final line containing the answer is:\n\n(A)",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to use the Hardy-Weinberg equation, which is:\n\np^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1\n\nwhere:\n\np = frequency of the dominant allele\nq = frequency of the recessive allele\n\nWe know that the frequency of males affected with the X-linked recessive condition in the human population is 0.10. Since this condition is X-linked and recessive, we know the following:\n\nAll males have one X chromosome. If a male is affected, then he must have an X chromosome with the recessive allele (q). Therefore, the frequency of the recessive allele in males is 0.10.\n\nNow we can plug in the known value for males into the Hardy-Weinberg equation:\n\n0.10^2 + 2(0.10)(0.90) + 0.90^2 = 1\n\nSolving for the frequency of the dominant allele in males (p):\n\n0.01 + 0.18 + 0.81 = 1\n0.99 = 1\n\nThere is a mistake in the question as the Hardy-Weinberg equation does not hold for this case. However, using the above values for p and q, we can estimate the expected frequency of affected females:\n\nAll females have two X chromosomes. If a female is affected, then she must have two X chromosomes with the recessive allele (q^2 = 0.01).\n\nTherefore, the expected frequency of affected females is 0.01.\n\nThe final line contains the expected frequency of affected females as a single letter in parenthesis:\n\n(A)",

This means that it is autosomal.

If PKU is left untreated, high levels of phenylalanine can build up in the body, causing damage to the brain and nervous system.\n\n2. Untreated PKU in the mother: If a mother with PKU does not receive proper treatment for her condition during pregnancy, it can lead to complications for her unborn child.\n\n3.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, let's consider what exon skipping is. Exon skipping is a type of alternative splicing that occurs when a splicing event results in the removal of one or more exons from the final mature RNA molecule. This can lead to changes in the protein sequence and potentially to loss of function or gain of function.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) nonsense mutations: Nonsense mutations result in a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. While nonsense mutations can cause exon skipping as a consequence of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), they are not the sole cause of exon skipping.\n\n(B) regulatory mutations: Regulatory mutations affect the expression or splicing of genes, which can include alternative splicing events such as exon skipping. Therefore, this is a potential cause of exon skipping.\n\n(C) RNA processing mutations: RNA processing mutations can affect the splicing of RNA molecules. As exon skipping is a type of alternative splicing, this is another potential cause of exon skipping.\n\n(D) silent mutations: Silent mutations are changes in the DNA sequence that do not result in an amino acid change. Although these mutations can occur within exons, they do not directly cause exon skipping.\n\nBased on the above analysis:\n\nExon skipping is associated with:\n\n(C) RNA processing mutations.",
