By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we'll examine the information in the prompt and the possible options for Sukarno's neutral stance:\n\nPrompt: The quote is from Sukarno's keynote address to the Bandung Conference in 1955. The Bandung Conference was a gathering of 29 African and Asian nations to promote economic and cultural cooperation and oppose colonialism. It is reasonable to assume that Sukarno's attempt at a neutral stance during the 1950s or 1960s would relate to conflicts that were prominent during that time.\n\n- (A) The Arab-Israeli conflict: The conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors dates back to the 1940s and continues to the present. However, the most significant events during Sukarno's time would have been the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and the 1967 Six-Day War. It's possible that Sukarno attempted to maintain neutrality during these events.\n- (B) The Korean War: The Korean War occurred from 1950 to 1953, during Sukarno's time as Indonesia's president. Neutrality would have been challenging during this conflict, as Indonesia supported North Korea, but not in an official capacity.\n- (C) The Cold War: The Cold War spanned from the end of World War II in 1945 to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Indonesia, under Sukarno's leadership, was part of the Non-Aligned Movement, which aimed to remain neutral during the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n- (D) The Vietnam conflicts: The conflicts in Vietnam took place during the mid-20th century, with the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Vietnam War (1955-1975). Considering Sukarno's speech was in 1955, his attempts at neutrality would have likely related to the First Indochina War and the early years of the Vietnam War.\n\nUpon examining the options, we can conclude that Sukarno likely attempted, but did not completely succeed, in maintaining a neutral stance during the:\n\n(C) the Cold War.",

As a result, Korea was divided into two zones, with the Americans in the south and the Soviets in the north.\n5.
