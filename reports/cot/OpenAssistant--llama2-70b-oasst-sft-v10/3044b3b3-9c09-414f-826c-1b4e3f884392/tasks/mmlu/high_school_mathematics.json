Then we have:\n\na + (n-1)d = 240, where n is the number of terms in the sequence.\n\nWe know that a must be an odd integer, so we can write a = 2k-1 for some integer k. Substituting this into our equation above, we get:\n\n2k-1 + (n-1)d = 240\n\nSimplifying this gives us:\n\n2k + (n-1)d - 1 = 240\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:\n\n4k + 2(n-1)d = 480\n\nSubtracting 4k from both sides, we get:\n\n2(n-1)d = 480 - 4k\n\nDividing both sides by 2(n-1) to isolate d, we get:\n\nd = (480 - 4k)/(2(n-1))\n\nWe know that d must be an odd integer as well, so we can write d = 2m-1 for some integer m. Substituting this into our equation above, we get:\n\nd = (480 - 4k)/(2(n-1)) = (240 - 2k)/(n-1), since (480 - 4k)/2 = 240 - 2k\n\nNow, we need to find all pairs of integers (k, m) such that:\n\n1. k is an integer greater than or equal to 1 (to ensure that a is odd)\n2. m is an integer greater than or equal to 1 (to ensure that d is odd)\n3. (240 - 2k)/(n-1) is an integer (to ensure that d is an integer)\n4. n is an integer greater than or equal to 3 (since we need at least three terms to form an arithmetic sequence)\n\nWe can use trial and error to find all such pairs of integers (k, m) that satisfy the above conditions. We can start with k = 1 and increment it until we find all possible pairs. For each value of k, we can find all possible values of m that satisfy (240 - 2k)/(n-1) is an integer. Then, for each value of m, we can check if n is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and if d is an odd integer. If all these conditions are satisfied, then we have found a valid pair (k, m) that gives rise to an arithmetic sequence of consecutive odd integers whose sum is less than or equal to 240.\n\nNote: Since d is an odd integer, we only need to check if (240 - 2k)/(n-1) is an even integer for each value of m. If it is even, then d will be odd.\n\nNow, let's go through the trial and error process:\n\nk = 1:\nm = 1: (240 - 2(1))/(n-1) = 239/(n-1), which is not an integer. So, we cannot have m = 1 for k = 1.\nm = 3: (240 - 2(1))/(n-1) = 238/(n-1), which is an integer. We have n = 7 as the smallest integer greater than or equal to 3. So, we have the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, which sums up to 240.\nm = 5: (240 - 2(1))/(n-1) = 236/(n-1), which is an integer. We have n = 9 as the smallest integer greater than or equal to 3. So, we have the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, which sums up to 240.\nk = 3:\nm = 1: (240 - 2(3))/(n-1) = 234/(n-1), which is an integer. We have n = 11 as the smallest integer greater than or equal to 3. So, we have the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, which sums up to 240.\nm = 3: (240 - 2(3))/(n-1) = 230/(n-1), which is an integer. We have n = 13 as the smallest integer greater than or equal to 3. So, we have the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, which sums up to 240.\n\nNote: We have not checked for higher values of k greater than 3 since we have already found three arithmetic sequences of consecutive odd integers whose sum is 240.\n\nHence, there are 3 arithmetic sequences of consecutive odd integers that sum to 240.\n\n(C) 10",
