A quick search in PubMed for \"human polyomavirus\" returns 4,646 results as of today, January 2023.  However, the number of human polyomaviruses has changed over time as new ones have been discovered.  Ten were discovered between 2007 and 2012 and number 13 was discovered in 2022.  \n\nIt's important to note that the number will additionally change as new ones are discovered in the future, or as some are disputed by the scientific community and are retired. But as of 2023, 13 are acknowledged.\n\nSo the answer is...\n\n(C) 13",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, let's consider the factors in the question: limited access to safe water and low levels of education. These factors suggest that newborn infants in these countries may be at higher risk of infections and diseases, and that their caregivers may not have access to the same level of healthcare information and resources as those in more developed countries.\n\nNow let's analyze each of the answer choices:\n\n(A) Exclusively formula fed for six months: While formula feeding can be a safe and appropriate choice for some infants, it may not be the best option for those in countries with limited access to safe water. This is because formula requires clean water for mixing, and if the water is not clean, it can introduce harmful bacteria or contaminants into the formula.\n\n(B) Exclusively breast fed for six months: Breast milk is a natural and highly nutritious food for infants, and it provides immunities and antibodies that can help protect infants from infections and diseases. Breastfeeding does not require clean water or specialized equipment, making it a more practical option for infants in countries with limited resources.\n\n(C) Should receive both breast milk and other foods as tolerated in the first 6 months: While it is true that infants eventually need to start eating solid foods, introducing them too early can pose risks, especially in countries with limited access to safe water and food resources. The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, followed by continued breastfeeding with the introduction of complementary foods.\n\n(D) months: This answer choice is incomplete and does not provide enough information.\n\nBased on the information provided and the World Health Organization's recommendations, the best answer for newborn infants in countries with limited access to safe water and low levels of education is:\n\n(B) Exclusively breast fed for six months",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine which segment of society is most important for achieving effective change in a community, we can consider the diffusion of innovations theory, which describes how new ideas and technologies spread through a population.\n\nThe theory identifies five distinct groups of individuals who adopt new ideas and technologies at different stages:\n\n- Innovators: these are the first to adopt a new idea or technology. They are often risk-takers and willing to try something new.\n\n- Early adopters: these are the second group to adopt a new idea or technology. They are influenced by the innovators and are usually opinion leaders in their community.\n\n- Early majority: these are the third group to adopt a new idea or technology. They are more cautious than the first two groups but are willing to adopt once they see the benefits of the new idea or technology.\n\n- Late majority: these are the fourth group to adopt a new idea or technology. They are more resistant to change and only adopt once the majority of the community has already done so.\n\n- Laggards: these are the last group to adopt a new idea or technology. They are highly resistant to change and may never adopt the new idea or technology.\n\nGiven this framework, it seems that early adopters (option B) are the key segment of society for achieving effective change in a community. This is because they serve as opinion leaders who can influence the adoption of new ideas and technologies by the early majority. Once the early majority adopts the new idea or technology, it can quickly spread throughout the rest of the community.\n\nSo, the answer is (B) Early adopters.",

They are more specialized than regular T cells, but they are still not the most specialized characteristic of the adaptive immune system.\n\n(D) Clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells: Clonal expansion is the process by which a small number of specific immune cells, either antibody-producing B cells or T cells, rapidly divide and produce large numbers of identical cells with the same antigen-specific receptors. This process allows the immune system to quickly and efficiently mount a response to a specific pathogen. While clonal expansion involves both antibodies and T cells, it is a more specialized process that is unique to the adaptive immune system.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system is:\n\n(D) Clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells",
