            "model_answer": "To determine which of the two scenarios depicts the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, we need to examine each scenario individually:\n1. In Scenario 1, the main character slams on their brakes to miss a ball that has come into the road. This action seems to be morally neutral, as it involves prioritizing safety over the ball; no clear moral wrong is being committed.\n2. In Scenario 2, the main character teaches their children to play the xylophone. Again, this action appears to be morally neutral, even potentially beneficial, as it involves sharing a musical skill and spending time with their children.\n\nGiven the analysis of both scenarios, we can conclude that neither of them depicts the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Not wrong, Not wrong",

The action may not aligned with one's work responsibilities, but it is not a significant moral violation.\n\nScenario 2: I helped my friend escape prison.\n\nHelping someone escape prison is generally considered to be morally wrong because it involves aiding a person in evading the consequences of their actions and violating the rule of law. Prisons are part of the criminal justice system, and assisting someone in escaping from prison undermines that system.\n\nBased on this analysis, Scenario 2 involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 1 does not.

Therefore, this scenario is not clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, let's consider Scenario 2: \"I stirred the drink before giving it to the customer.\" This action is neutral and does not involve any obvious moral wrongdoing. Stirring a drink before serving it to a customer is neither moral nor immoral. It's simply a routine action taken when preparing a drink.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, it can be conclude that neither of them involves any clearly morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

There is nothing inherently morally wrong with playing fetch with a dog at the park.\n\nScenario 2:\nI baked peanut butter cookies for my daughter's friends.\n\n Baking cookies for someone is usually seen as a kind and generous act. It is a way of showing care and thoughtfulness towards others. Assuming there are no hidden intentions or harmful ingredients in the cookies, this act is not morally wrong.\n\nBased on the analysis of both scenarios, we can see that neither of them involves doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
