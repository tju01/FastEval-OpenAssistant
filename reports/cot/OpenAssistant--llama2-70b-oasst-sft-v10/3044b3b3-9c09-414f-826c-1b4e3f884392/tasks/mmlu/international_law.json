            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the principle of exclusive flag state jurisdiction. \n\nExclusive flag state jurisdiction is a principle of international law that holds that a state has exclusive jurisdiction over vessels registered in that state, even when the vessel is in the territorial sea of another state. This principle is recognized in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which is an international agreement that establishes legal framework for the oceans and seas.\n\nArticle 92 of UNCLOS stipulates that the flag state has the exclusive right to prescribe rules concerning the organization, equipment, and operation of vessels flying its flag, as well as to ensure that such rules are complied with.\n\nNow let's examine each of the provided options:\n(A) The coastal State: While the coastal state may have jurisdiction over crimes committed within its territorial waters, it does not have exclusive jurisdiction over vessels flying the flag of another state.\n(B) The flag State: Pursuant to Article 92 of UNCLOS, the flag state exercises exclusive jurisdiction over vessels flying its flag, including in respect of crimes committed on board.\n(C) All States enjoy such jurisdiction: This is incorrect as the principle of exclusive flag state jurisdiction establishes that only the flag state has such jurisdiction.\n(D) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea: This tribunal does not exercise jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels; its mandate is to adjudicate disputes between states concerning the interpretation or application of UNCLOS.\n\nBased on the principles of international law and the UNCLOS provisions, the correct answer is:\n(B) The flag State",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the meaning of justiciability, let's examine each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) says that justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders. This option seems to focus on the ability of individuals or organizations to enforce their rights through legal means.\n\n(B) proposes that justiciability refers to the just nature or cause of a particular right. This option focuses on the moral or ethical basis for a right, rather than its enforceability.\n\n(C) suggests that justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular right conforms to principles of justice. This option places the focus on the judicial system's role in determining whether a right has been properly enforced.\n\n(D) states that justiciability refers to the obligation of a State to enforce a particular right. This option highlights the responsibility of the State in ensuring that rights are upheld.\n\nUpon reviewing these options, option (A) appears to provide the most accurate definition of justiciability, as it emphasizes the enforceability of rights through legal means.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

            "question": "In what way is Responsibility to Protect (R2P) different from humanitarian intervention?\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer the question, we need to compare and contrast the two concepts: Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and humanitarian intervention.\n\nR2P is a principle that holds that sovereign states have a responsibility to protect their populations from mass atrocity crimes, such as genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing. If a state is unable or unwilling to protect its people from such crimes, the international community has a responsibility to step in and provide protection. R2P was endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly in 2005.\n\nHumanitarian intervention, on the other hand, is a unilateral or collective act of force by a state or states to prevent or alleviate widespread and severe human suffering in another state. The primary motivation for humanitarian intervention is to protect civilians from harm, but it can also involve other goals, such as promoting democracy or creating a stable political environment. The legality and legitimacy of humanitarian intervention are contested issues in international law and politics.\n\nNow, let us evaluate the given answer choices:\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention - This is not true. R2P is a principle that focuses on the protection of civilians from mass atrocity crimes, while humanitarian intervention is a specific type of action (usually involving military force) to prevent or alleviate human suffering.\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress - This is not true. Unlike humanitarian intervention, R2P does not require the consent of the state being affected. The international community can intervene even if the state is unwilling or unable to protect its populations.\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis - This is true. R2P is grounded in international law and requires the involvement of the UN Security Council (UNSC) in determining the appropriate response to a potential humanitarian crisis. This makes it less arbitrary than humanitarian intervention, which can be unilateral and driven by the interests of the intervening state(s).\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not - This is not true. While R2P may include the use of military force, it also encompasses non-military measures such as diplomatic efforts, sanctions, and other non-coercive actions. Humanitarian intervention, on the other hand, typically involves the use of force, but it can also involve non-military measures.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to identify the definition that best fits the concept known as the 'Lotus principle'. The Lotus principle is a doctrine in international law that concerns the relationship between states and their powers.\n\n(A) This option discusses the concept of restrictions upon the independence of states and states that 'whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law.' This definition aligns with the Lotus principle, as it highlights the idea that states have the freedom to act unless explicitly prohibited by international law. The 'whatever is not prohibited is permitted' statement, in particular, is a well-known characterization of the Lotus principle.\n\n(B) This option talks about states' freedom to choose the court for submitting their disputes. While this concept is related to international law, it does not correspond to the Lotus principle.\n\n(C) This option addresses states' ability to assert their enforcement jurisdiction on the high seas. While this concept touches on international law, it is not connected to the Lotus principle.\n\n(D) This option mentions the development of customary law from state practice and opinio juris. While this is an important concept in international law, it is not the Lotus principle.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the best answer is:\n\n(A) The so-called Lotus principle is that 'restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed', or, as it has been construed, 'whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law'",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine which statement best describes the UK Constitution, let's analyze each statement:\n\n(A) The UK Constitution's only source of power is that of the sovereign\nWhile the Monarch (the sovereign) still technically possesses certain powers, the UK Constitution is not solely based on the sovereign's power. The concept of parliamentary sovereignty, which means that Parliament has the ultimate authority to make and unmake laws, is a key aspect of the UK Constitution. Therefore, this statement is not accurate.\n\n(B) The UK Constitution gives the judiciary the power to overturn acts of parliament\nAlthough the judiciary plays an essential role in interpreting and applying the law, it does not have the power to overturn acts of Parliament in the UK. The principle of parliamentary sovereignty, as mentioned earlier, means that Parliament retains supremacy over all other branches of government, and the judiciary cannot override its decisions. Hence, this statement is also incorrect.\n\n(C) The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources\nThis statement is accurate. The UK Constitution is not a single, written document. Instead, it is an accumulation of various laws, principles, and conventions that have evolved over time. It can be found in sources such as Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, Acts of Parliament, and common law, among others. This makes the UK Constitution flexible and adaptable, as it can be modified through new legislation, court decisions, and established practices.\n\n(D) The UK Constitution is based on a Bill of Rights\nWhile the UK does have a Bill of Rights (passed in 1688), it is not the sole foundation of the UK Constitution. The Bill of Rights is an important document that establishes certain rights and liberties, such as freedom of speech in Parliament and the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. However, it is just one of the many sources that contribute to the overall framework of the UK Constitution.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that best describes the UK Constitution is:\n\n(C) The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we should start by analyzing each option and determining which one best reflects the obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes in international law.\n\n(A) This option suggests that states are under a strict obligation to resolve their disputes as soon as possible. While the peaceful settlement of disputes is indeed an important principle in international law, it does not impose a strict obligation on states to resolve disputes immediately.\n\n(B) This option states that the obligation is one of conduct, meaning that states have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means, but not necessarily to achieve a resolution. This option seems more in line with the actual obligation of states in international law, as it recognizes their duty to engage in peaceful negotiations and other peaceful means of dispute resolution.\n\n(C) This option suggests that the peaceful settlement of disputes is a peremptory norm of international law, meaning it is a fundamental principle that cannot be derogated from. While the peaceful settlement of disputes is certainly an important principle in international law, it is not necessarily a peremptory norm.\n\n(D) This option claims that the obligation concerns solely international courts and tribunals. This is not accurate, as the obligation of peaceful settlement of disputes applies to states, not just international courts and tribunals.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most accurate answer seems to be:\n\n(B) It is an obligation of conduct, ie States have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means.

Instead, it introduced the single judge formation for handling admissibility decisions, which was separate from the existing three-judge committee.\n\n(B) Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility.\n\nThis statement is true.
