            "model_answer": "To determine the appropriate size of cannula for a patient who needs a rapid blood transfusion, we should consider the following factors:\n\n1. The desired flow rate of the transfusion: A larger cannula size will allow for a higher flow rate, which is important in a rapid transfusion.\n\n2. The diameter of the cannula: A larger diameter cannula will have a higher flow rate, but also a higher risk of complications such as bleeding and bruising.\n\n3. The patient's vein size: The size of the cannula should be appropriate for the patient's vein size to minimize the risk of complications.\n\nBased on these factors, the recommended cannula size for a rapid blood transfusion is typically 18 gauge. This size provides a balance between flow rate and risk of complications.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) 18 gauge.",

Strength is essential for maintaining good running form and avoiding injury, but it is not the primary factor that determines success in long-distance running.\n\n(B) Power: Power refers to the ability to generate force quickly. Although power can be useful in short-distance running, it is not as critical in marathon running, where endurance is the priority.\n\n(C) Stride length: Stride length can affect running efficiency, but it is not the most critical factor in marathon running. A longer stride length might help runners cover more ground with each step, but it is not the primary factor that determines success over 26.2 miles.\n\n(D) Stamina: Stamina refers to the ability to sustain prolonged physical exertion. In marathon running, where the goal is to complete a long distance race, stamina is crucial.

Anaphylaxis can cause upper airway swelling and obstruction, so stridor can be a symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\n(B) Bradycardia: Bradycardia refers to a slow heart rate. However, anaphylaxis typically causes an increase in heart rate (tachycardia) due to the release of histamine and other chemicals. Therefore, bradycardia is NOT a symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\n(C) Severe wheeze: Wheezing is a common symptom of anaphylactic reactions.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer the question, we need to understand how the body's metabolism changes during sprinting and with an increasing number of sprints.\n\nSprinting is a high-intensity, anaerobic exercise, meaning it relies heavily on the anaerobic breakdown of glucose to produce energy quickly. During sprinting, the body uses its stored glucose, or glycogen, in the muscles to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the energy currency of the cell. This process, known as glycolysis, is anaerobic because it occurs without the involvement of oxygen.\n\nAs the number of sprints increases, the body continues to rely on anaerobic metabolism to generate the necessary energy. However, the body also ramps up its aerobic metabolism to help recover from the anaerobic efforts and replenish energy stores. This means that with an increasing number of sprints, both anaerobic and aerobic metabolism contribute to the energy demands of the body.\n\n(A) is partially correct, but it does not fully capture the changes that occur with an increasing number of sprints.\n(B) is incorrect. While anaerobic metabolism does produce acidic byproducts, the body has buffering mechanisms in place to prevent the pH of the muscle from falling that low.\n(C) is incorrect. Blood glucose concentration may initially fall during sprinting due to glycogen breakdown, but with an increasing number of sprints, the body will begin to mobilize glucose from other sources, such as the liver, to maintain blood glucose levels.\n(D) is the most accurate answer. With an increasing number of sprints, the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases because the body ramps up its aerobic metabolism to help recover from the anaerobic efforts and replenish energy stores.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n(D) the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases.",

Diplopia can still occur even with one eye covered.\n\n(B) The outer image is always the false image\nThis statement is also false because whether the outer image or inner image is the false one depends on the type of misalignment of the eyes.\n\n(C) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards\nThis statement is false. A fourth nerve palsy is characterized by a downward and outward displacement of the affected eye that occurs due to a lesion in the fourth nerve (trochlear nerve). This nerve is responsible for controlling the superior oblique muscle.\n\n(D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint\nThis statement is true. A sixth nerve palsy occurs when there is a lesion in the sixth nerve (abducens nerve). This nerve is responsible for controlling the lateral rectus muscle. When the nerve is injured, the affected eye cannot move outward properly, resulting in a convergent squint (esotropia) rather than a divergent squint (exotropia).\n\nStep 3: Identify the correct statement\nBased on our analysis, the correct statement is (D): A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the effects of sodium bicarbonate ingestion on the body, specifically on the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid.\n\nSodium bicarbonate is a weak base, meaning it can neutralize acid. When ingested, it can help raise pH levels in the extracellular fluid, making it less acidic. This can, in turn, enhance the buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid, enhancing its ability to neutralize acid produced by muscles during exercise.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n- (A) suggests that sodium bicarbonate ingestion elevates the pH levels and enhances the buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid, promoting a faster efflux of hydrogen ions. This fits with what we know about sodium bicarbonate's effects.\n- (B) states that sodium bicarbonate reduces the pH levels and buffering capacity. This is not in line with what we know about sodium bicarbonate's effects.\n- (C) proposes that sodium bicarbonate ingestion raises pH levels but somehow slows the influx of hydrogen ions into muscles. This doesn't match the known effects of sodium bicarbonate.\n- (D) claims that sodium bicarbonate elevates pre-exercise muscle pH, but this does not necessarily translate to improved running performance.\n\nBased on the knowledge that sodium bicarbonate ingestion raises extracellular fluid pH and improves buffering capacity, the answer is:\n\n(A) elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.",

However, it is not the molecule that directly transports fatty acids into the mitochondria.\n\n(C) Acetyl-CoA: Acetyl-CoA is an important molecule in metabolism, and it can be generated from the breakdown of fatty acids via the citric acid cycle. However, it is not the molecule responsible for transporting fatty acids into mitochondria.\n\n(D) Carnitine: Fatty acyl-CoAs are activated by the addition of CoA, forming acyl-CoAs. These acyl-CoAs are then transported into mitochondria by a carrier protein that binds to carnitine, which is attached to the acyl-CoA.
