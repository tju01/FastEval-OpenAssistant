Identify the action: The action in the sentence is \"teaches.\"\n\n3. Create a variable for the subject: We can represent \"David\" using the variable \"d.\"\n\n4. Create a variable for the object: We can represent \"Chris\" using the variable \"c.\"\n\n5. Create a predicate for the action: We can represent the action \"teaches\" using the predicate \"T.\"\n\n6. Combine the predicate, subject, and object: To create the predicate logic sentence, we need to combine the predicate, subject, and object in the correct order. In this case, the correct order is subject, predicate, object. Therefore, we get the sentence \"T(d, c).\"\n\n7.
