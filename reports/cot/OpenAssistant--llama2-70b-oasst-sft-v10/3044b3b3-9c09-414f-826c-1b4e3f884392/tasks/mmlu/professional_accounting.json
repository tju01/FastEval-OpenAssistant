However, this statement does not address all aspects of nonsampling risk.\n\n(B) Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.\nThis statement is also partially correct. Nonsampling risk arises from auditor judgment, taxonomy errors, and improper use of audit techniques. Although the statement adds an additional source of nonsampling risk, it does not encompass the overall concept.\n\n(C) Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.\nThis statement is not accurate. Sampling risk arises from the possibility that conclusions drawn from a sample may differ from those drawn if the entire population had been audited. It does not specifically relate to uncertainty in applying audit procedures.\n\n(D) Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.\nThis statement is also not accurate. Sampling risk relates to drawing conclusions about a population, not selecting inappropriate audit procedures.\n\nAfter analyzing each statement:\n\n(A) partially addresses the concept of nonsampling risk.\n(B) partially addresses the source of nonsampling risk.\n(C) is not accurate regarding sampling risk.\n(D) is not accurate regarding sampling risk.\n\nTherefore, based on the given options, the closest answer to the question is:\n(A) Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.",

The focus here is on internal controls, not on events that happened after the year end.\n\n(C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end:\nReviewing bank statements after the year end can help identify any transactions or events that occurred subsequent to the year end that may have an impact on the financial statements. This option is specifically focused on subsequent events.\n\n(D) Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited:\nComparing interim financial statements can help identify any changes or trends that may have occurred since the year end, but it is not specifically focused on subsequent events that could have a direct impact on the financial statements.\n\nBased on the analysis, option (C) seems to be the most appropriate procedure for auditors to perform regarding subsequent events, as it directly involves reviewing bank statements for several months after the year end to identify any transactions or events that may have an impact on the financial statements.\n\nFinal answer: (C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.",

So, this could be the answer.\n\n(B) Emerging Issues Task Force Releases: The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) is a group within the FASB that identifies and discusses emerging accounting issues. While the EITF provides guidance, it does not directly issue changes to the Accounting Standards Codification. So, this is not correct.\n\n(C) Statements of Financial Accounting Standards: The Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) were issued by the FASB prior to the codification process. The codification process was completed in 2009, which means that any new updates or changes to the standards must be issued in the form of Accounting Standards Updates. So, this is not the correct answer.\n\n(D) Staff Technical Bulletins: Staff Technical Bulletins (STB) are issued by the FASB staff, not the FASB board. They provide guidance on application or interpretation of financial accounting and reporting standards, but do not officially amend or add to the Accounting Standards Codification.

            "model_answer": "Since Dean Co. incorrectly used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method to amortize the premium, it means that the bond carrying amount was not amortized properly.\n\nUsing the straight-line method, the bond carrying amount would have been amortized evenly over the life of the bond, resulting in a lower amortization of the premium in the early years and a higher amortization in the later years. In contrast, the effective interest method would have resulted in a more accurate amortization of the premium, where the amortization is higher in the early years and lower in the later years.\n\nTherefore, at June 30 year 12, the bond carrying amount would have been overstated (higher than it should have been) because the amortization of the premium was not accurate. As a result, the retained earnings would have been understated (lower than it should have been) because the higher bond carrying amount would have resulted in a higher interest expense, reducing the net income and therefore the retained earnings.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\n(B) Understated Overstated",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each statement and determine its accuracy based on the information provided.\n\n(A) It will be reclassified as an asset held for sale.\n- This statement is correct. Since the company is actively marketing the old building for sale and expects to complete the sale within four months, it should be classified as an asset held for sale.\n\n(B) It will be classified as a current asset.\n- This statement is incorrect. An asset held for sale is not considered a current asset. Current assets are short-term assets constantly changing in value, such as stocks, debtors, and bank balances. Assets held for sale are considered non-current assets.\n\n(C) It will no longer be depreciated.\n- This statement is correct. Depreciation is the reduction in value of an asset due to wear and tear, age, and obsolescence. Since the old building is being actively marketed for sale, it is no longer in use, so there is no need to depreciate the asset.\n\n(D) It will be valued at historical cost.\n- This statement is incorrect. Historical cost refers to the original cost of an asset when it was acquired. Assets held for sale are typically valued at their fair value (market value) rather than their historical cost. The fair value is the price that a buyer and a seller would agree upon in an arms-length transaction.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the incorrect statement is:\n\n(B) It will be classified as a current asset.",
