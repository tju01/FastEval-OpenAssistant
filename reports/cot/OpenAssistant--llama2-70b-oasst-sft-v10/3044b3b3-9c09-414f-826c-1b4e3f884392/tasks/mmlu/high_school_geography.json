            "question": "The main factor preventing subsistence economies from advancing economically is the lack of\n\n(A) a currency.\n(B) a well-connected transportation infrastructure.\n(C) government activity.\n(D) a banking service.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question\nThe question asks to identify the main factor that hampers the economic advancement of subsistence economies. \n\nStep 2: Define key terms\nA subsistence economy is a type of economy in which most people produce the bulk of their own food and other basic necessities, with little surplus for trade or sale.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each answer choice\n(A) A currency could facilitate trade and exchange, but it is not the primary factor that hinders economic advancement in subsistence economies.\n(B) A well-connected transportation infrastructure could improve access to markets and resources, but it is not the main factor that prevents economic growth in subsistence economies.\n(C) Government activity, such as policies, regulations, and infrastructure development, can have both positive and negative impacts on subsistence economies. However, it's not the primary factor that prevents their advancement.\n(D) A banking service could provide credit and other financial services, which can help facilitate economic growth. However, without a well-functioning economy, it is unlikely that banking services would be the main factor preventing advancement.\n\nStep 4: Determine the best answer\nAfter evaluating each answer choice, it is clear that none of them is the single main factor preventing subsistence economies from advancing economically. However, if we have to choose one, option (B) a well-connected transportation infrastructure seems to be the closest answer, as it can improve access to markets, resources, and information, which are critical for economic growth.\n\nAnswer: (B) a well-connected transportation infrastructure.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The question is about the tendency of a population to continue growing even after replacement fertility has been achieved.\n\n(A) Zero population growth refers to a situation where the population size remains constant, with birth and death rates balanced. This is not the correct answer, as the question refers to a growing population.\n\n(B) Rapid growth rate refers to a situation where the population is growing quickly. However, it doesn't necessarily imply that the growth will continue even after replacement fertility has been achieved.\n\n(C) Homeostatic plateau refers to a stable state in which a system remains in equilibrium. This term is not commonly used in population growth studies.\n\n(D) Demographic momentum refers to the tendency for a population to continue growing even after replacement fertility has been achieved, due to the high proportion of young people in the population who will eventually reach childbearing age. This is the correct answer, as it matches the definition provided in the question.\n\nAnswer: (D) demographic momentum.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Burgess's concentric zone model of urban form is a theory that describes the structure and organization of cities. It consists of five concentric zones, each with its own distinct characteristics:\n\n1. CBD (Central Business District)\n2. First ring (zone of transition)\n3. Second ring (zone of working class housing)\n4. Third ring (zone of better-quality residences)\n5. Fourth ring (zone of commuting residents)\n\nIn this model, the zone that contains low-income slums, ethnic ghettos, and general deterioration would be the first ring, also known as the zone of transition. This is because this zone is characterized by a mix of commercial and residential uses, with lower-income residents and lower-quality housing. As such, it is the most likely area to experience the negative effects of urbanization and poverty.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Second.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To find the correct answer, we need to evaluate each statement separately based on available data:\n\n(A) Most women work in agriculture: According to the World Bank, women constitute 43% of the agricultural labor force globally. While this is a significant portion, it does not constitute the majority of women's work, as many women are employed in other sectors and occupations.\n\n(B) The percentage of women economically active in the labor force declined worldwide: According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the global female labor force participation rate has been slowly increasing over the past decades and was around 48.5% in 2018. This indicates that the percentage of women in the labor force is increasing, not declining.\n\n(C) The percentage of women in the total labor force declined: This statement contradicts the information provided above, which states that the global female labor force participation rate has been increasing.\n\n(D) Women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia: Based on ILO data, women tend to spend more hours on unpaid care and domestic work than men, which is not accounted for in standard labor force statistics. Men generally spend more time on paid work, so this statement is unlikely to be true.\n\nBased on the evaluation of each statement, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) The percentage of women economically active in the labor force declined worldwide",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's examine each of the provided options to determine which one is not a pull factor of migration:\n\n(A) Safety: If a person feels unsafe in their current location due to high crime rates, war, or other security threats, they may choose to migrate to a place where they feel safer. Therefore, safety is a pull factor of migration.\n\n(B) Better climate: People may choose to migrate to a location with a more favorable climate, such as moving from a cold, snowy climate to a warmer, sunnier climate. Better climate is a pull factor of migration.\n\n(C) Better schools: Access to quality education is an important factor for many people, especially those with children. If one location has better schools than another, it can act as a pull factor for migration.\n\n(D) Overcrowding: Overcrowding refers to a situation where an area has too many people living in it, leading to issues such as high housing costs, traffic congestion, and noise pollution. Overcrowding is more likely to be a push factor or reason to leave a location, rather than a pull factor to attract people to a new one.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the answer is:\n(D) overcrowding.",

We need to find the country that does not have a well-known example of a relict boundary.\n\nStep 2: Define \"relict boundary.\" A relict boundary is a geological feature that marks the boundary between two tectonic plates or regions that were once joined but have since separated.\n\nStep 3: Research the geology of each country.\n\na) Vietnam: Vietnam is located in Southeast Asia and is part of the Indo-China Peninsula. It is situated near the Sunda Plate and the Eurasian Plate, and has a history of tectonic activity.\n\nb) United Kingdom: The United Kingdom is located in northwestern Europe and is part of the Eurasian Plate. It is situated near the boundary between the Eurasian Plate and the North American Plate, and has a history of tectonic activity, including the formation of the Irish Sea.\n\nc) Germany: Germany is located in central Europe and is part of the Eurasian Plate. It is situated near the boundary between the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate, and has a history of tectonic activity, including the formation of the Rhine Graben.\n\nd) Bolivia: Bolivia is located in South America and is part of the South American Plate. It is situated near the boundary between the South American Plate and the Nazca Plate, and has a history of tectonic activity, including the formation of the Andes Mountains.\n\nStep 4: Identify the country that does not have a well-known example of a relict boundary.\n\nFrom the research above, we can see that all of the countries have a history of tectonic activity and are situated near plate boundaries. Therefore, none of them fit the criteria of not having a well-known example of a relict boundary.\n\nHowever, if we had to choose the country that is least likely to have a well-known example of a relict boundary, it would be:\n\n(B) United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom does not have as pronounced a plate boundary as the other countries, and its geology is more dominated by glacial and volcanic features.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine which form of migration farm workers from another country are most likely to be practicing during the year, let's examine each option:\n\n(A) Chain migration: This occurs when people from one community follow others from the same community who have already migrated. It's possible that farm workers from another country may practice chain migration, but it's not the most likely option given the context.\n\n(B) Cluster migration: This occurs when people from the same community or region tend to migrate to the same destination. Although it's possible that farm workers from another country may practice cluster migration, it's not the most likely option given the context.\n\n(C) Circular migration: This occurs when people migrate cyclically, usually for seasonal work. Given that farm workers typically migrate for seasonal work opportunities, circular migration is the most likely option in this context.\n\n(D) International migration: This refers to people moving from one country to another for various reasons, such as work or family reunification. Although farm workers from another country are technically engaging in international migration, the question specifically asks for the form of migration being practiced during the year, which makes circular migration a more appropriate answer.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the answer is:\n\n(C) Circular migration",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first clarify what a centrifugal force is. In simple terms, centrifugal force is a force that pushes outward from a central point, often in a rotating system. In the context of a country, we can interpret this as a force that causes people or groups within the country to move away from a central point or idea.\n\nNow let's examine each of the options and determine which one represents a centrifugal force in a country:\n\n(A) Religious differences: Religious differences can lead to divisions and tensions among people in a country, causing them to move away from a central point or idea.\n\n(B) A national holiday: A national holiday is an event that brings people together and promotes unity, so it is unlikely to be a centrifugal force.\n\n(C) An attack by another country: An attack by another country can cause fear and chaos, and may lead to divisions within a country. However, it is not necessarily a force that pushes people away from a central point or idea.\n\n(D) A charismatic national leader: A charismatic national leader can inspire people and bring them together around a central goal or idea. This would more likely have a centripetal force (pushing towards a central point) rather than a centrifugal force.\n\nConsidering the definitions and examples, the option that best represents a centrifugal force in a country is:\n\n(A) Religious differences",

While this climate might be conducive to human settlement, it is not necessarily linked to coastlines and rivers specifically.\n\n(B) Limited forest cover: Limited forest cover could make certain areas more suitable for human settlement, but it is not a primary reason for early settlements and high population density along coastlines and rivers.\n\n(C) Growth of manufacturing: The growth of manufacturing is generally a result of urbanization and industrialization, which came later in history. It is not a primary reason for early settlements along coastlines and rivers.\n\n(D) Access to trade routes: Coastlines and rivers provide access to waterways, which have always been critical for transportation and trade. Early settlements along these areas would have allowed populations to engage in trade, access resources, and expand their reach.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best answer is (D) Access to trade routes.",
