            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the difficulties in using the access matrix approach to protection:\n\n(A) The matrix size grows linearly with the number of subjects and objects, which can lead to a large and clumsy matrix in complex systems. However, this can be mitigated by using technical solutions, such as hashing or indexing, to optimize storage and retrieval of permissions. Additionally,u\u00e9iUI the memory requirements and performance implications of the access matrix are manageable, using modern computing technology .\n(B) The access matrix can express complex protection requirements by assigning fine-grained permissions to subjects and objects. It allows for identifying specific subjects and objects and managing their permissions individually. So, this is not a significant difficulty.\n(C) Deciding whether a process has access to a resource in an access matrix is decidable. It involves a simple lookup in the access matrix and comparing the process's subject ID with the resource's object ID to find the corresponding permission. As the access matrix is a finite and static data structure, this decision process is straightforward and deterministic. \n(D) In an access matrix, there must be an entity or mechanism with the authority to modify the access matrix itself. This mechanism can be incorporated within the access control system, such as an access control manager or administrator. The administrator can grant or revoke permissions by updating the access matrix, ensuring the access control system's integrity.\n\nAfter analyzing the possible difficulties, we can conclude that option (B) is not a significant challenge, and options (C) and (D) are manageable with proper design considerations. Therefore, the main difficulty with the access matrix approach to protection is:\n\n(A) the matrix, if stored directly, is large and can be clumsy to manage.",

It divides memory into units of equal size.\n\nIn a segmented memory system, memory is divided into segments, each with its own base address and length. The segments may have different sizes, but they must be a multiple of a specific unit size (e.g., a page size). Therefore, this statement is partially true, as memory is divided into units (segments) of equal base address, but the length of each segment may vary.\n\nII. It permits implementation of virtual memory.\n\nSegmented memory systems can be used as a foundation for implementing virtual memory. In this case, each segment is treated as a virtual address, and the operating system manages the mapping between virtual and physical addresses. The segmented memory system itself does not inherently provide virtual memory, but it can be used in conjunction with other techniques to achieve virtual memory. Therefore, this statement is not true for a purely segmented memory system, but it can be true when segmented memory is used in combination with other mechanisms.\n\nIII. It suffers from internal fragmentation.\n\nSegmented memory systems can suffer from internal fragmentation, which occurs when memory is divided into segments that are too large or too small to efficiently use the available memory space. This can lead to situations where memory is wasted because it cannot be allocated to the process that needs it. Therefore, this statement is true for a purely segmented memory system.\n\nBased on the analysis of each statement:\n\n(A) I only - Incorrect, as the first statement is partially true.\n(B) II only - Incorrect, as the second statement is not true for a purely segmented memory system.\n(C) III only - Correct, as the third statement is true for a purely segmented memory system.\n(D) I and III - Incorrect, as the first statement is only partially true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) III only.",
