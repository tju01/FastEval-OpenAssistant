            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) The content of the media is determined by market forces: This statement suggests that media content is shaped by the demands of the audience and advertisers, rather than any other external factors.\n\n(B) The subordinate classes are dominated by the ideology of the ruling class: This statement suggests that the ideas and beliefs of the ruling class are imposed on the subordinate classes, and that they are unable to challenge or resist this dominant ideology.\n\n(C) The media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers: This statement suggests that the media have the power to influence and control the behavior of the audience, who are seen as vulnerable and easily manipulated.\n\n(D) Audiences make selective interpretations of media messages: This statement suggests that audiences actively interpret and make sense of media messages in ways that are influenced by their own experiences and beliefs.\n\nNow, let's consider the mass-society theory. This theory suggests that modern society is characterized by the mass production and consumption of goods and ideas, and that this has led to a loss of individuality and a sense of alienation. The theory argues that the media play a key role in shaping the attitudes and behaviors of the masses, and that they have the power to manipulate and control them.\n\nBased on this understanding of the mass-society theory, the statement that best fits the theory is:\n\n(C) The media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers.",

This is a possible interpretation of his views.\n\n(B) learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career\nThis option suggests that Becker believed cannabis use was something that people learned over time through their involvement in deviant behavior. This is also a possible interpretation of his views.\n\n(C) a dangerous pastime that young people should not be allowed to pursue\nThis option suggests that Becker believed cannabis use was dangerous and should be prohibited for young people. This interpretation of his views is less likely, as it does not align with his general perspective on deviance.\n\n(D) not as enjoyable as other sociologists had suggested\nThis option suggests that Becker believed cannabis use was not as pleasurable as other sociologists had suggested. This interpretation of his views is less likely, as it does not directly relate to his theories on deviance.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most likely answer is:\n\n(B) learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each of the given options step-by-step and see which one(s) best describe the middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century.\n\n(A) an urban set, involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations:\nDuring the nineteenth century, urbanization and industrialization led to the growth of cities. The middle class, which consisted of professionals, managers, and business owners, were often based in urban areas. They were involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations as they had an interest in the development and well-being of their communities. So, this option seems accurate.\n\n(B) too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness:\nThe middle class was diverse in terms of occupation, income, and social background. Therefore, it is possible that this diversity made it challenging for the middle class to develop a strong sense of class consciousness. This option could be accurate as well.\n\n(C) often involved in 'white collar' work:\nThe term \"white collar\" work refers to professional, administrative, and managerial jobs that typically require specialized education and training. The growth of industry, commerce, and bureaucracy during the nineteenth century provided opportunities for the middle class to engage in such work. Hence, this option is accurate.\n\n(D) all of the above:\nAfter analyzing options A, B, and C, it appears that all three describe aspects of the nineteenth-century middle class. Therefore, option D, which states \"all of the above,\" accurately encompasses the characteristics of the middle class during that period.\n\nSo, the answer is: (D) all of the above.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of gemeinschaft and how it relates to the given options.\n\nGemeinschaft, developed by Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies, refers to a type of social relationship based on family-like bonds and community ties. In this type of relationship, individuals share common values, traditions, and a strong sense of belonging.\n\nNow let's examine each of the given options:\n\n(A) Organic solidarity, proposed by \u00c9mile Durkheim, refers to the interdependence and cohesion of individuals in modern societies based on division of labor and specialization. This type of solidarity arises from the interdependence of individuals in a complex society, where each person has a specific role to play.\n\n(B) Mechanical solidarity, also proposed by Durkheim, refers to the social bond based on similarity and unity among individuals in traditional societies. In this type of solidarity, individuals share common beliefs, values, and practices, which lead to a strong sense of community.\n\n(C) Gesellschaft, another concept developed by T\u00f6nnies, refers to a type of social relationship based on rational and contractual interactions between individuals. In this type of relationship, individuals come together for specific purposes, such as economic or political goals, and the bonds between them are based on self-interest and functional roles.\n\n(D) Anomie, proposed by Durkheim, refers to a state of normlessness and lack of social regulation in modern societies. It arises when individuals are faced with a lack of clear social norms and values, which leads to a sense of confusion and alienation.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the concept of gemeinschaft developed by Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies describes basically the same relational characteristics as:\n\n(B) mechanical solidarity",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to analyze each of the given options and determine which one best explains the growth in income inequality in the 1980s.\n\n(A) Rates of income tax increased equally for all occupational groups: This option suggests that income tax increases affected all occupational groups equally, which would not result in a growth in income inequality. If anything, it would make the income distribution more equal.\n\n(B) There were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them: This option suggests a shortage of skilled workers for professional jobs. However, this would not necessarily lead to an increase in income inequality. In fact, it could lead to higher wages for those workers who are able to fill the available professional jobs, which would reduce income inequality.\n\n(C) The price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings: This option suggests that the cost of living increased faster than earnings, which would lead to a decrease in the purchasing power of lower-income workers, while higher-income workers would be less affected by the increase in the cost of living. This would result in an increase in income inequality.\n\n(D) Growing unemployment made more people dependent on welfare benefits: This option suggests that unemployment increased during the 1980s, leading to a larger portion of the population relying on welfare benefits. However, this would not necessarily lead to an increase in income inequality, as welfare benefits are typically intended to support low-income individuals and families.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best explanation for the growth in income inequality in the 1980s is:\n\n(C) the price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the meaning of \"normalized\" in the context of deviant acts. If a deviant act is normalized, it means that the act is considered to be within the bounds of acceptable behavior, and it is no longer seen as deviant. Therefore, we can eliminate options A, C, and D, as they all refer to situations where the deviant act is still considered abnormal:\n\n(A) The act is still recognized as breaking an important norm of behavior.\n(C) The act is still seen as deviant and could be the first step in establishing a deviant career.\n(D) The act is still attributed to the person's genetic or anatomical makeup, which is seen as abnormal.\n\nThis leaves us with option B:\n\n(B) The act is seen as a temporary aberration from an otherwise 'normal' character.\n\nWhile this option suggests that the act is deviant, it also implies that it is not considered to be a reflection of the person's long-term behavior or character, and thus, it is \"normalized\" in a sense. However, it's important to note that \"normalized\" has different meanings in different contexts, and the correct answer may depend on the specific situation and the perspective of the observer.\n\nSo, the answer is: (B) The act is seen as a temporary aberration from an otherwise 'normal' character.",

This oppression is manifest in various ways, including economically, politically, and sexually.\n\n(C) Women's domestic labour being exploited by the capitalist economy: While Marxist feminists are concerned with the exploitation of women's domestic labour, it is not the primary explanation they offer for patriarchy.\n\n(D) The dual systems of capitalism and male domination: This option is partially correct, as Marxist feminists do see patriarchy and capitalism as interconnected systems of oppression.
