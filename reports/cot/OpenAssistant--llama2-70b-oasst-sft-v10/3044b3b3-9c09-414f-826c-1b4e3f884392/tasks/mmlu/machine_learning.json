            "model_answer": "Let's examine the two statements separately:\n\nStatement 1: Linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.\n- This statement is false. While linear regression estimators can have small variances, they do not necessarily have the smallest variances among all unbiased estimators. The variance of an estimator depends on the specific data and model being used, and there may be other unbiased estimators that have smaller variances for a given situation.\n\nStatement 2: The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\n- This statement is true. In AdaBoost, the coefficients \u03b1 are assigned to classifiers in a way that always results in non-negative values. This is because the objective of AdaBoost is to minimize the weighted sum of the errors made by the classifiers, and assigning negative coefficients would not contribute to this goal.\n\nGiven these explanations, the correct answer is:\n(C) True, False",

RoBERTa indeed pretrains on a corpus that is approximate 10x larger than the corpus BERT pretrained on.\n\n  Statement 2: ResNeXts in 2018 usually used tanh activation functions.\n\nThis statement is difficult to reliably answer because neither 'ResNeXt' nor 'tanh' activation functions were popular or in-use abundantly in 2018. \n\n 'ResNeXt' and 'SE-ResNeXt' were introduced as a probabilistic variant of ResNet by Lukasz Kaiser in 2017.

Both logistic regression models and SVMs are commonly used in machine learning for classification tasks. While the underlying algorithms and techniques differ, both methods can output a probability distribution over the possible labels for a given input example.\n\n\nStatement 2:\nWe would expect the support vectors to remain the same in general as we move from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels.\n\nThis statement is false. In SVM implementation, the kernel function is a crucial component that determines the mapping between the input space and the higher dimension feature space. The nature of this mapping is what allows the algorithm to be able to separate non-linearly separable samples in higher dimensions. When we switch from linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernel, this mapping entirely changes, causing a completely different arrangement of supporting vectors in the feature space. As such, we should not expect the support vectors to remain the same as we change the kernel function.\n\nComparing the truth-values of each statement, we get False, True.

The goal of EM is to find the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters by alternating between two steps: the E step and the M step.\n- In the E step, the algorithm computes the expected value of the complete likelihood function, given the observed data and the current estimates of the parameters. In the M step, the algorithm updates the parameter estimates to maximize the expected complete likelihood function.\n- Convergence of the EM algorithm is not always guaranteed, and it is possible for the log-likelihood to decrease or plateau during iterations. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nStatement 2: One disadvantage of Q-learning is that it can only be used when the learner has prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment.\n- Q-learning is a popular model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that can learn to make optimal decisions based on the Q-values of actions in different states.\n- The Q-values represent the expected return, or long-term reward, for taking a particular action in a given state. Q-learning updates these values using a temporal difference (TD) error, which is the difference between the current Q-value for a state-action pair and the updated Q-value after observing the next state and reward.\n- Q-learning does not require prior knowledge of the environment dynamics, only the reward function.
