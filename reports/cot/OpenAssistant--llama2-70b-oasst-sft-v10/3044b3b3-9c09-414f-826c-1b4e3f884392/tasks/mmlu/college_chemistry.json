In other words, the rate of the reaction remains constant even as the concentration of the reactants changes.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of a chemical reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactants raised to the power of their coefficients in the balanced chemical equation.\n\nFor a zero-order reaction, the power of the concentration of the reactant is 0, so the rate of the reaction does not depend on the concentration of the reactant.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the rate of a zero-order reaction A \u2192 B is:\n\n(D) r = k",

Thus, we can eliminate this option.\n\n(B) \"IR peak intensities are related to molecular mass\": While there is some correlation between IR peak intensities and molecular mass, it is not a strong or direct enough relationship to be useful for structural determination. Hence, we can eliminate this option as well.\n\n(C) \"most organic functional groups absorb in a characteristic region of the IR spectrum\": This option is plausible as IR spectroscopy often uses the absorption of radiation by functional groups to deduce structural information. The fact that most organic functional groups absorb in characteristic regions of the IR spectrum allows for the identification of these groups and, by extension, certain aspects of the molecular structure.\n\n(D) \"each element absorbs at a characteristic wavelength\": Although each element does absorb at a characteristic wavelength, the resulting spectra are often too complex and difficult to interpret for structural analysis.

The lever arm length is defined as the distance between the two pure components in the phase diagram.\n\nStep 2: Apply the lever rule to a three-component system\nIn a three-component system, there are three pure components (A, B, and C) and two binary interactions (AB, AC, and BC). At equilibrium, each of these binary interactions will have a lever arm length equal to one-half of the total length of the phase diagram.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the maximum number of phases\nSince each binary interaction has a lever arm length of one-half, the total length of the phase diagram is 3/2. Therefore, the maximum number of phases that can be at equilibrium with each other in a three-component mixture is 3/2.\n\nHowever, this answer is not one of the given options, so there may be an error in the question or the available options.",

Each of these spin states will absorb at a different frequency in an EPR experiment, resulting in multiple lines in the spectrum.\n\nThe parameter J represents the strength of the spin-spin coupling between the two nitrogen nuclei.

Since each spin state will absorb at a different frequency, there will be four lines in the EPR spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) 3 lines",

This is a possible way to produce cobalt-60.\n\n(B) Alpha particles: Alpha particles are positively charged and have a mass of 4 amu.
