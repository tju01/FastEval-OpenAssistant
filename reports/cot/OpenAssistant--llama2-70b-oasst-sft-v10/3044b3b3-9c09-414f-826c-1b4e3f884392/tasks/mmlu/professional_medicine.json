            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step:\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization: The patient did not show any neurological symptoms or signs associated with a cerebral infarction.\n\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement: Although complications can occur with IVC filter placements, the patient's decreased sensation is not in the area where the filter was placed.\n\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve: The patient's decreased sensation is over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh, which aligns with the distribution of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. This nerve can be compressed by tight or constricting clothing, a hematoma, or other causes that put pressure on the nerve.\n\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh: Although the patient had a hematoma that was resolving, the sensation of numbness and tingling is in a different area from the hematoma.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation is:\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve",

            "model_answer": "To determine the most likely diagnosis for the 25-year-old gravida 3 para 2 female admitted to the hospital at 39 weeks' gestation in active labor, let's analyze each option step by step:\n\n(A) Braxton Hicks contractions: Braxton Hicks contractions are irregular, unpredictable contractions that occur throughout pregnancy. They are usually less painful and less frequent than true labor contractions. However, in this case, the woman is in active labor with regular contractions every 4 minutes, so Braxton Hicks contractions are unlikely to be the cause.\n\n(B) Lower uterine retraction ring: A lower uterine retraction ring is a complication that can occur after a previous cesarean section. It is a band of scar tissue that forms around the lower part of the uterus and can cause pain and difficulty during labor. However, there is no mention of a previous cesarean section in this case, so this diagnosis is unlikely.\n\n(C) Hypotonic uterine dysfunction: Hypotonic uterine dysfunction refers to a situation where the uterus is unable to contract effectively during labor. This can be due to a variety of factors, such as uterine overdistension, maternal exhaustion, or fetal position. In this case, the woman is having only a few intermittent, weak contractions, and her cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated, which suggests that her uterus is contracting effectively. Therefore, hypotonic uterine dysfunction is unlikely to be the diagnosis.\n\n(D) Primary dysfunctional labor: Primary dysfunctional labor is a term used to describe a situation where labor is not progressing as expected, despite no apparent obstruction. In this case, the woman is in active labor but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is fully effaced and 7 cm dilated. This suggests that there is no obstruction to the labor process, and therefore, primary dysfunctional labor is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is (D) primary dysfunctional labor.",

            "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of a low-grade fever, cough, and runny nose. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo (p=0.04). Which of the following is the most appropriate interpretation of these study results?\n\n(A) The findings are clinically and statistically significant\n(B) The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant\n(C) The findings are clinically significant but statistically insignificant\n(D) The findings are neither clinically nor statistically significant",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, let's examine the difference in mean time for resolution of symptoms. We can calculate this difference with the formula:\n\nDifference = Mean time for new drug - Mean time for placebo\n\nDifference = 6.4 days - 6.7 days\nDifference = -0.3 days\n\nSince the difference is negative, it means that the placebo group had a longer mean time for resolution of symptoms, which suggests that the new drug appeared to be effective in reducing the duration of symptoms.\n\nNow let's consider the statistical significance. The p value of 0.04 indicates that there is a statistically significant difference between the mean times for resolution of symptoms in the two groups. This means that the difference is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone.\n\nHowever, we should also consider the clinical significance of the difference. The absolute difference in mean time for resolution of symptoms is only 0.3 days, which is relatively small. This means that, although the new drug appeared to be statistically effective in reducing the duration of symptoms, the effect size is quite small, and it is unclear whether the difference is clinically meaningful.\n\nBased on these considerations, the most appropriate interpretation of these study results would be:\n\n(B) The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant",

This leads to increased excretion of sodium bicarbonate and decreased excretion of hydrogen ions, making the urine more alkaline.\n\n(B) Na+ \u2013Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor\nThese drugs work by inhibiting the co-transport of sodium and chloride ions in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron. This leads to increased excretion of sodium and chloride ions, which causes diuresis and natriuresis.\n\n(C) Na+ \u2013K+ \u20132Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor\nThese drugs work by inhibiting the co-transport of sodium, potassium, and two chloride ions in the distal tubule of the nephron. This leads to increased excretion of sodium, potassium, and chloride ions, which causes diuresis, natriuresis, and kaliuresis.\n\n(D) Osmotic diuretic\nThese drugs work by increasing the osmotic pressure in the proximal tubule of the nephron, leading to increased water reabsorption and decreased reabsorption of solutes like sodium, potassium, and chloride ions. This causes diuresis and natriuresis.\n\nStep 3: Choose the appropriate pharmacotherapy\nGiven that the man has increased calcium excretion in his urine, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be one that helps to decrease the excretion of calcium. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors have been shown to reduce calcium excretion by increasing the urinary excretion of bicarbonate, which binds to calcium and forms insoluble calcium carbonate. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is:\n\n(A) Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor",
