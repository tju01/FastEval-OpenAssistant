So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal.

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

It suggests that conflict over energy reserves is unlikely as long as this economic order exists. This view leans more towards a liberal perspective as it highlights international cooperation, free trade and implies a belief that markets can efficiently distribute resources.\n\n(B)\nThis statement predicts energy scarcity as a source of future disruptions and the emergence of a new international energy order dominated by statism and neo-mercantilism. This perspective suggests a potential breakdown of liberal free-market trading, which aligns less with a liberal perspective.\n\n(C)\nThis statement describes the current order as unequal and unjust, and suggests that those who benefit from it will ensure the continuation of the energy flow under favorable conditions. It implies that the distribution of energy resources is driven by capitalist elites, which doesn't align well with a liberal perspective on energy security.\n\n(D)\nThis statement posits that energy scarcity could lead to a return to geopolitical confrontation and 'resource wars', with states competing and potentially conflicting over control of major reserves. This view also leans away from a liberal perspective on energy security, as it predicts increased conflict and a breakdown of cooperation.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) most closely aligns with a liberal perspective on future energy security, as it highlights international cooperation, free trade, and the maintenance of the current economic order.\n\nThe final line with the answer is: (A)",

This may lead to western countries imposing their values and cultures on other societies, which can be seen as a form of neo-colonialism.\n\n(B) Human security promotes global capitalism:\nThe human security concept often emphasizes the importance of a globalized world and economic growth. Critics may argue that this focus on global capitalism can lead to the interests of powerful countries and corporations overshadowing the needs and rights of individuals and communities.\n\n(C) Human security is too broad:\nThe human security concept encompasses a wide range of issues, including economic, social, and political aspects.

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",
