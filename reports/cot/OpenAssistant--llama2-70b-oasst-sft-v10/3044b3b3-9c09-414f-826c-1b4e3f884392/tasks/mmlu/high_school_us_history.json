In its magnificent domain of space and time, the nation of many nations is destined to manifest to mankind the excellence of divine principles; to establish on earth the noblest temple ever dedicated to the worship of the Most High\u2014the Sacred and the True. Its floor shall be a hemisphere\u2014its roof the firmament of the star-studded heavens, and its congregation a Union of many Republics, comprising hundreds of happy millions, calling, owning no man master, but governed by God's natural and moral law of equality, the law of brotherhood\u2014of 'peace and good will amongst men.'\"\nJohn L. O'Sullivan, \"The Great Nation of Futurity,\" 1839\nBy what means did the United States take possession of the Oregon Territory?\n\n(A) The United States was granted the territory in a postwar treaty with France.\n(B) The United States bought it from the Native Americans who lived there.\n(C) U.S. settlers were the first to arrive in the region; they claimed it for their country.\n(D) Great Britain ceded it to the United States as part of a negotiated treaty.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Let's evaluate each option step-by-step to find out the accurate answer:\n\n(A) The United States was granted the territory in a postwar treaty with France.\nHowever, the United States claims to Oregon Territory came not from France, but under the law of discovery from Britain. After 1819 Spain ceded its rights to the region to the United States. This option is therefore incorrect. \n\n(B) The United States bought it from the Native Americans who lived there.\nThere was no treaty between the United States and Native Americans about buying the Oregon Territory. Although there were several interactions and treaties between United States and native American tribes living in the region, they were about trade and friendship, not land. Additionally Native Americans had been dispossessed from the territory but treaties to that effect were not the means by which the US gained control. This option is therefore incorrect.\n\n(D) Great Britain ceded it to the United States as part of a negotiated treaty.\nThe Oregon Treaty of 1846 between The United States and Britain secured the Oregon territory for the United States. This is supported by reliable sources, and is the closest available choice to the historically accurate answer. \n\n(C) U.S. settlers were the first to arrive in the region; they claimed it for their country.\nWhile U.S. settlers were indeed among the first to settle the area, it wasn't until the Oregon Treaty of 1846 that the region officially became part of the United States. This option is therefore incorrect.\n\nSo the winner is:\n(D) Great Britain ceded it to the United States as part of a negotiated treaty.",

            "model_answer": "The task at hand is to determine the economic consequences of the in infamy date of which the United States was attacked by Japan as spoken by President Franklin D. Roosevelt from the context that is provided. The right answer must be among the multiple choices provided.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n- A suggests the war caused economic recession in US and Europe due to a decrease in trade with Asian nations. From the context in the passage about the events of that date we cannot tell what the state of trade relations between the US and other nations were. But economic recession is usually caused by a large scale decrease of demand far beyond that which can be caused by a decrease in trade.  A decrease in foreign trade alone would not cause a decrease in demand on the scale of a full recession.\n\n- B states that the US became prosperous because the economies of Asia and Europe was obliterated by the war. However, wars do not usually cause prosperity for nations that partake in them since war involves billions or possibly trillions of capital being channeled into the military and the reparations that come after it and destruction of infrastructure that would have been invested in for long term economic production. The countries of Asia and Europe would have to have been prosperous as well for their economies to have been vastly destroyed by war. Furthermore, there is nothing in the provided context that corroborates with this idea; it does not even mention where Asia and Europe's economic state was during that time.\n\n- C suggests Cold War tensions caused both the US and SU's economies to struggle. While there is military conflict and economic intrigue between the two countries, it is extraneous information that does not pertain to the context provided by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. \n\n- D says Japan was forced into depression because it had to pay money to the US applying a large scale decrease in demand from decreased income. This is a general principle of economics that planting money into a country usually causes the economy to grow, and taking money out of a country usually causes the economy to shrink. It is also predicted by the concept that economic production for the long term usually requires the establishing of infrastructure that costs lots of money. This would require destruction of infrastructure for as much money that is taken out of the country as is being asked for in reparations. There is also the concept of monetary inflation that by decreasing the amount of currency (or increasing the amount of goods) the money represents, the currency increases in perceived value and thus purchasing power, that would increase the economy of the nation. \n\nConsidering each option in the multiple choice question, only option D has an economic principle that can be justified following from the context.\n\nAuthor's Answer: D",
