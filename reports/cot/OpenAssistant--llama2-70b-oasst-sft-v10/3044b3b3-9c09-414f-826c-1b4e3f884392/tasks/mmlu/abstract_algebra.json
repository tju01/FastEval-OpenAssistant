However, we need to determine if it's irreducible or not.\n\nConsidering the equation x^2 = 2, we can see that it has no roots in Q, and thus, it is irreducible over Q. Therefore, the degree of the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q is 2.\n\nStep 3: Find the minimal polynomial of sqrt(3).\n\nSimilar to the previous step, sqrt(3) is a real number, which means it's also algebraic and has a minimal polynomial of degree 2. We need to determine if it's irreducible or not.\n\nConsidering the equation x^2 = 3, we can see that it has no roots in Q, and thus, it is irreducible over Q. Therefore, the degree of the minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q is 2.\n\nStep 4: Find the minimal polynomial of sqrt(18).\n\nWe first note that sqrt(18) = 3*sqrt(2) has a factor of sqrt(2). However, this factor is not irreducible, since sqrt(2) already has a minimal polynomial of degree 2.\n\nThus, sqrt(18) has a minimal polynomial of degree 1 over Q(sqrt(2)). Explicitly, we can find this minimal polynomial by factoring out the factor of sqrt(2) from the minimal polynomial of sqrt(18):\n\n(x - sqrt(2))(x + sqrt(2)) = x^2 - 2.\n\nThe minimal polynomial of sqrt(18) is thus x + sqrt(2).\n\nStep 5: Find the composite degree.\n\nSince the minimal polynomial for each element in the extension field has degree 2, the composite degree of the extension field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q must be 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n\nStep 6: Output the answer.\n\nHowever, none of the given options match this answer.

Since G is non-Abelian, there exists some element c in G such that (ab)c \u2260 c(ab).
