            "model_answer": "First, let's identify the context or language in which the word \"murtis\" is used.\n\nMurti is a Sanskrit term used in Hinduism to refer to a sacred image or statue, typically of a deity. It is often used in the context of Hindu temple worship and rituals.\n\nNow let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) Offerings - In Hinduism, offerings are made to deities, but the term \"murtis\" specifically refers to the images or statues of the deities themselves, not the offerings.\n(B) Prayers - Prayers are an important aspect of Hindu worship, but again, the term \"murtis\" specifically refers to the sacred images or statues, not the act of praying.\n(C) Apparitions - This term refers to ghostly appearances or visions, which is not related to the Hindu concept of murtis.\n(D) Idols - In this context, idols refer to images or statues that are worshiped as deities. This is closely related to the Hindu concept of murtis.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the most appropriate translation for \"murtis\" in this context would be:\n\n(D) Idols",
