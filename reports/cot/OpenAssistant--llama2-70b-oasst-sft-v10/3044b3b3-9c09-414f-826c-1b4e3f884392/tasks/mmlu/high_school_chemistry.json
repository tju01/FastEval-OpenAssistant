            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe have a sealed, rigid container with three gases: nitrogen, argon, and water vapor. We need to find the partial pressure of nitrogen in the container.\n\nStep 2: Use Dalton's Law of partial pressures\nDalton's Law states that the total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases. We can write this mathematically as:\nP_total = P_nitrogen + P_argon + P_water vapor\n\nStep 3: Set up the equation\nWe're given that the total pressure exerted by the gases is 2.0 atm, and we know the masses of the three gases. Using Dalton's Law, we can set up the equation as:\n2.0 atm = P_nitrogen + P_argon + P_water vapor\n\nStep 4: Find the partial pressure of each gas\nTo find the partial pressure of nitrogen, we first need to calculate the partial pressures of all the gases in the container. We can do this by using the ideal gas law for each gas:\nP_gas = M_gas * R * T\n\nwhere P_gas is the partial pressure, M_gas is the molar mass of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. Assuming the temperature is the same for all three gases (we don't have information to suggest otherwise), we can find the partial pressure of each gas:\nP_nitrogen = 28.0 g * (1 mol / 14.01 g) * 0.0821 L*atm/(mol*K) * T\nP_argon = 40.0 g * (1 mol / 39.95 g) * 0.0821 L*atm/(mol*K) * T\nP_water vapor = 36.0 g * (1 mol / 18.02 g) * 0.0821 L*atm/(mol*K) * T\n\nStep 5: Calculate the partial pressure of nitrogen\nNow that we have the partial pressures for all three gases, we can plug them into Dalton's Law to find the partial pressure of nitrogen:\n2.0 atm = P_nitrogen + P_argon + P_water vapor\nP_nitrogen = 2.0 atm - P_argon - P_water vapor\n\nP_nitrogen = 2.0 atm - (0.0821 * 40.0 g / 39.95 g) atm - (0.0821 * 36.0 g / 18.02 g) atm\nP_nitrogen = 2.0 atm - (0.1033 atm) - (0.1827 atm)\nP_nitrogen = 0.7540 atm\n\nStep 6: Answer the question\nThe partial pressure of nitrogen is 0.7540 atm. However, we need to find which of the given options matches our answer. Dividing 0.7540 atm by 2.0 atm gives us 0.377, which is closest to 0.33 among the options:\n\n(A) 0.33 atm\n(B) 0.40 atm\n(C) 0.50 atm\n(D) 2.0 atm\n\nFinal answer: (A) 0.33 atm",

Representative elements are elements in groups 1, 2, 13-18 of the periodic table that do not contain f-block elements.\n\nNow let's examine each of the answer choices:\n\n(A) very soluble: Solubility depends on various factors such as the nature of the compound and the solvent. It is not a property that is specific to monatomic ions of representative elements.\n\n(B) very electronegative: Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract electrons in a chemical bond. Monatomic ions of representative elements can have a wide range of electronegativities, so this is not a general property.\n\n(C) isoelectronic with a noble gas: Isoelectronic means having the same number of electrons. Noble gases have a full valence electron shell and are very stable. Monatomic ions of representative elements that have lost or gained electrons will not have the same number of electrons as a noble gas, so they are not isoelectronic.\n\n(D) highly colored: The color of an element or compound is related to the energy levels of its electrons and how they absorb and reflect light. Monatomic ions of representative elements often have electrons in excited states, which can lead to the absorption of specific wavelengths of light and result in color.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) highly colored",

Next, we need to account for the charges on each ion. The ions have the following charges: Rb+ = +1, Se2- = -2, As5+ = +5, and Sr2+ = +2.\n\n3.

Sulfuric acid has hydrogen atoms bound directly to the sulfur atom, forming a stronger acid because the loss of a proton leads to the formation of a stable sulfate ion (SO4^2-) as the conjugate base. In contrast, sulfurous acid has hydrogen atoms bonded to oxygen atoms, which are then bonded to sulfur.
