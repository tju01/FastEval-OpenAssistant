            "model_answer": "First, let's briefly describe each style of fuzzer:\n\n- **Generational**: This type of fuzzer generates inputs from scratch, usually using randomness.\n- **Blackbox**: This type of fuzzer does not have access to the program's source code but tests it as a black box, only interacting with its input/output interface.\n- **Whitebox**: This type of fuzzer has access to the program's source code and uses information about the code to guide the exploration of input values.\n- **Mutation-based**: This type of fuzzer takes existing inputs and applies mutations to them to generate new inputs.\n\nTo determine which style of fuzzer is more likely to explore paths covering every line of code, we need to consider the effectiveness of each style:\n\n- Generational fuzzers are good at exploring new paths but may not be effective at coverage because they generate inputs from scratch, without any knowledge of the code.\n- Blackbox fuzzers test the program as a blackbox without any information about the code, which can limit their ability to explore specific paths.\n- Whitebox fuzzers have access to the code, which allows them to guide the exploration based on code coverage, making them more effective at covering all lines of code.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is (C) Whitebox.",

            "question": "Assume that a TLS connection has been established successfully between a client and a server. Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client and server don\u2019t leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good. Which of the following attacks does TLS protect against?\n1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier.\n2. An attacker impersonating the server.\n\n(A) True, True\n(B) False, False\n(C) True, False\n(D) False, True",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's evaluate each attack scenario separately:\n\n1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier:\nTLS uses sequence numbers and message authentication codes (MACs) to protect against replay attacks. The server maintains a sequence number for each message it receives, and the client includes this sequence number in the message. The server verifies the sequence number and the MAC before accepting the message, ensuring that it has not been previously received or modified. Therefore, TLS protects against replay attacks.\n\n2. An attacker impersonating the server:\nIn a TLS connection, the server provides a certificate that the client uses to verify the server's identity. The certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA), ensuring that the server is who it claims to be. If the client does not provide a client certificate, the server will still verify the client's identity using the server's certificate. This process helps prevent an attacker from impersonating the server, as they would not have access to the server's private key to sign the certificate.\n\nBased on the above evaluations, we can conclude that TLS protects against both replay attacks and server impersonation attacks in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) True, True.",

What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n\n(A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\n(B) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\n(C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n(D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Kerberos is an authentication protocol that relies on tickets to provide access to resources. Each ticket has an expiration time that determines its validity period. When a client wants to access a server, it presents its ticket to the server, which must then verify its validity.\n\n(A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\n\nThis statement is incorrect because the KDC does not establish connections between clients and servers; instead, it is responsible for issuing tickets.\n\n(B) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\n\nThis statement is also incorrect because Kerberos does not rely on server-side timers to enforce ticket expiration. Sever terminating a connection after 24 hours would not necessarily guarantee that the ticket is no longer valid.\n\n(C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n\nThis statement is partially correct. Server does indeed check the expiration time of the ticket, however it does not compare it to the server's current time. Server instead sends a message to the KDC asking whether the ticket is still valid.\n\n(D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.\n\nThis statement is correct. When a client presents an expired ticket, the server sends a message to the KDC asking whether the ticket is still valid. The KDC uses its own clock to determine the ticket\u2019s validity and responds accordingly. If the ticket is expired, the KDC reports this to the server, which then refuses to authenticate the user.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.\n\nI hope this explanation was helpful.",

            "question": "Consider the paper Native Client: A Sandbox for Portable, Untrusted x86 Native Code by Yee et al. Ben Bitdiddle notes that NaCl uses Intel x86 segmentation to ensure that the sandboxed module does not read or write memory outside its own data area, and does not execute instructions outside its own code.

Please ignore trampoline and springboard code.\n\n(A) all instructions that modify segment state\n(B) all loads or stores to addresses that are not 0 mod 32\n(C) all indirect loads or stores (via an address in a register or variable)\n(D) all indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable)",

The mod 32 condition is arbitrary and does not directly relate to protecting the system from untrusted code.\n\n(C) all indirect loads or stores (via an address in a register or variable): Indirect loads and stores can be used in unsafe ways, as they allow data from untrusted memory to be loaded into trusted memory. Disallowing all indirect loads and stores could prevent some types of attacks.\n\n(D) all indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable): Indirect jumps can also be used in unsafe ways, as they allow untrusted code to execute trusted code. Disallowing all indirect jumps could prevent some types of attacks.\n\nBased on this analysis, the validator should forbid both indirect loads/stores and indirect jumps to ensure the safety of sandboxed code.
