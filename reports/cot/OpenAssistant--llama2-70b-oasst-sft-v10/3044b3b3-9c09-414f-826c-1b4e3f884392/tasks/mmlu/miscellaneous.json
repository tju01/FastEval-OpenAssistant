            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in relation to the given scenario:\n\n(A) Conferencing: This strategy involves a teacher and student working together to set goals, monitor progress, and provide feedback. While some form of conferencing may occur during the writing unit, it does not accurately describe the instructional strategy used to identify defining characteristics of short stories.\n\n(B) Discipline-based inquiry: This strategy involves students exploring a topic through a structured inquiry process within a specific discipline. In this case, the teacher is working with students to identify characteristics of short stories, which falls under the discipline of literature. This option seems promising.\n\n(C) Self-Regulated Strategy Development: This strategy focuses on helping students develop strategies for self-regulation during the learning process. Although self-regulation may play a role in the writing unit, it does not specifically describe the identification of characteristics within the genre.\n\n(D) Introduction-Body-Conclusion strategy: This strategy is a structure commonly used for organizing written work, especially essays. It focuses on organizing content rather than identifying characteristics of a genre.\n\nBased on the analysis of each option, option (B) Discipline-based inquiry best describes the instructional strategy used by the teacher to help students identify defining characteristics of short stories.\n\nAnswer: (B) Discipline-based inquiry",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each material's resistance and how it is affected by temperature changes:\n\n(A) Copper: Copper has a positive temperature coefficient of resistance, meaning its resistance increases as temperature increases. This makes copper's resistance moderately affected by temperature changes.\n\n(B) Carbon: Carbon is commonly used in the form of carbon-based materials like graphite or carbon nanotubes. These materials have a negative temperature coefficient of resistance, which means their resistance decreases as temperature increases. However, the temperature coefficient is still significant, making carbon's resistance affected by temperature changes, albeit to a lesser extent than copper.\n\n(C) Germanium: Germanium has a relatively high temperature coefficient of resistance (more significant than copper), which means its resistance changes significantly with temperature. Therefore, germanium's resistance is strongly affected by temperature changes.\n\n(D) Silicon: Silicon is a semiconductor, and its resistance is highly dependent on temperature. It has a negative temperature coefficient of resistance, but the coefficient is even higher than germanium's. This means that silicon's resistance changes dramatically with temperature.\n\nAfter analyzing the temperature coefficient of resistance for each material, we can conclude that:\n\n(C) Germanium and (D) Silicon have the most significant temperature dependence.\n(B) Carbon has less temperature dependence than the previous two but still has a noticeable effect.\n\nTherefore, the material with the resistance least affected by temperature changes is:\n\n(A) Copper",
