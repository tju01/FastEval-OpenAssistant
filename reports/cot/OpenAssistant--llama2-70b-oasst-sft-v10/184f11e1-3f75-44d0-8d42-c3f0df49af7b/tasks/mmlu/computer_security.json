They are good at finding security vulnerabilities but may not cover every line of code.\n\n(C) Whitebox fuzzers: These fuzzers have access to the source code of the program and use it to generate test inputs.

            "question": "Assume that a TLS connection has been established successfully between a client and a server. Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client and server don\u2019t leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good. Which of the following attacks does TLS protect against?\n1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier.\n2.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine which attacks TLS protects against, we must analyze each attack type separately.\n\n1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier:\n\nTLS uses sequence numbers for each record sent during a session. When the server receives a record, it checks the sequence number to ensure that it is consecutive to the previous received record. If an attacker tries to replay bytes that the client sent earlier, the server would discard the record as the sequence number would be incorrect. Therefore, TLS protects against replay attacks.\n\n2. An attacker impersonating the server:\n\nDuring the establishment of a TLS connection, the server sends its certificate to the client for validation. The certificate contains the server's public key and is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). The client verifies the certificate's signature using the CA's public key and checks that the domain name in the certificate matches the domain name of the server it is connecting to. This verification process helps prevent an attacker from impersonating the server.\n\nBased on the analysis above, TLS protects against both replay and server impersonation attacks.\n\nAnswer: (A) True, True",

            "question": "MIT\u2019s Kerberos KDC server has a maximum ticket lifetime of 24 hours (for most user principals). What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n\n(A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\n(B) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\n(C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n(D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D).\n\nThe Kerberos protocol relies on the KDC (Key Distribution Center) to issue tickets that are valid for a specific period of time. When a client connects to a server, it presents a ticket issued by the KDC. The server then sends a query to the KDC to verify the validity of the ticket.\n\nIn this case, the KDC is responsible for ensuring that expired tickets are no longer valid. The KDC has its own clock that it uses to timestamp the tickets it issues. When a server sends a query to the KDC to verify a ticket, the KDC compares the ticket's expiration time to its own clock. If the ticket has expired, the KDC will report back to the server that the ticket is invalid.\n\nThis ensures that expired tickets cannot be used to access services on the network, as the server will refuse to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the steps are as follows:\n\n1. User submits ticket to server for authentication.\n2. Server sends query to KDC to verify the validity of the ticket.\n3. KDC compares the ticket's expiration time to its own clock.\n4. If the ticket has expired, KDC reports back to server that ticket is invalid.\n5. Server refuses to authenticate user if ticket is invalid.\n\nThe answer in parenthesis is (D).",

It allows users to share and access information without revealing their real identities, making it a part of the darknet and a suitable tool for transferring files anonymously.\n\n(B) ARPANET: ARPANET was the first wide-area packet-switching network and the precursor to the modern Internet. It was developed in the late 1960s by the United States Department of Defense for research and communication purposes but is not associated with darknet or anonymous file transfer.\n\n(C) Stuxnet: Stuxnet is a malicious computer worm that was first discovered in 2010. It was designed to target and sabotage industrial control systems, particularly those used in nuclear power plants. Although Stuxnet is a sophisticated piece of malware, it is not related to darknet or anonymous file transfer.\n\n(D) Internet: The Internet is a global network of interconnected devices and computer networks that communicate using standardized protocols.

This can happen in C and C++ programs due to the way memory management and pointer usage are handled.\n\n(A) No string boundary checks in predefined functions: This can be a contributing factor. In C and C++, string functions like strcpy() and strlen() do not perform boundary checks on the input strings. If an attacker can control the input string length, they can potentially overflow the buffer size and compromise the program.\n\n(B) No storage check in the external memory: While the memory allocated in C and C++ programs is managed by the programmer, it is the responsibility of the programmer to allocate and free memory correctly. If memory is not allocated properly or freed when no longer needed, this can lead to vulnerabilities.\n\n(C) No processing power check: This is not a factor in buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Processing power does not affect the likelihood of a buffer overflow occurring.\n\n(D) No database check: This is also not a factor in buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
