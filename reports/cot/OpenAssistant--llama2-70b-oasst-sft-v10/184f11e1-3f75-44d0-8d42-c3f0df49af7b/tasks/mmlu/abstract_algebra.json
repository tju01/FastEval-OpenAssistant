            "model_answer": "To find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q, we need to determine the dimension of the vector space over Q.\n\nStep 1: Identify the elements of the field extension\nQ(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18))\n\nStep 2: Find the minimal polynomial for each element\nThe minimal polynomial for sqrt(2) is x^2 - 2\nThe minimal polynomial for sqrt(3) is x^2 - 3\nThe minimal polynomial for sqrt(18) is x^2 - 18\n\nStep 3: Find the greatest common divisor of the minimal polynomials\nThis is equal to the relative discriminant of the extension, which we'll call d. The minimal polynomials are all of degree 2, so the discriminant of each is 4 times the square of the coefficient of x, or in other words, 4 times the square of the difference between the roots. We have:\n(sqrt(2) - sqrt(2))^2 = 4(sqrt(2) - sqrt(2)) = 0\n(sqrt(3) - sqrt(3))^2 = 4(sqrt(3) - sqrt(3)) = 0\n(sqrt(18) - sqrt(18))^2 = 4(sqrt(18) - sqrt(18)) = 0\nTherefore, the relative discriminant is 0, which means that the extension is not Galois, and we must instead find the degree of the algebraic closure containing the field extension.\n\nStep 4: Find the algebraic closure of the field extension\nThe algebraic closure of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is obtained by adjoining all the roots of all irreducible polynomials over the extension. Since the minimal polynomial for each element in the extension is of degree 2, the algebraic closure will have degree 2^3 = 8 over Q.\n\nStep 5: Find the degree of the field extension\nThe degree of the field extension is equal to the dimension of the vector space over Q. In this case, the vector space is 3-dimensional (because we are adjoining three elements), so the degree of the extension is 3.\n\nHowever, since the extension is not Galois, we need to double the degree of the algebraic closure to get the degree of the extension, which is 2 * 8 = 16.\n\nAnswer: (A) 0",

If the original group is non-Abelian, then it has elements that do not commute. When we take the quotient by a normal subgroup, we are identifying elements that are in the same coset. This means that the factor group will still have elements that do not commute, since the normal subgroup cannot \"eliminate\" the non-commuting elements. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2: If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nReasoning: A normal subgroup is a subgroup that is closed under conjugation; that is, for any element a in the group and any element b in the normal subgroup, the conjugate a^b is also in the normal subgroup. If K is a normal subgroup of H, then it is closed under conjugation by elements in H. And if H is a normal subgroup of G, then it is closed under conjugation by elements in G. Since K is closed under conjugation by elements in H, and H is closed under conjugation by elements in G, we can conclude that K is closed under conjugation by elements in G.
