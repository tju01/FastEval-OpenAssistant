Convolutional layers are designed to extract features such as edges, textures, and shapes from image data. As high-resolution images have more pixels and details, convolutional networks excel at learning complex patterns from such images. This makes them a popular choice for image classification tasks.\n\n(B) Graph networks: Graph networks are used for representing relationships between individual data points (nodes) in a dataset. Graphs can represent non-Euclidean data, but they're not typically used for image classification directly.\n\n(C) Fully connected networks: Fully connected networks are feedforward neural networks where every neuron is connected to every other neuron in the next layer. Fully connected networks can classify images, but they're not as optimized as convolutional networks for leveraging hierarchical patterns present in image data.\n\n(D) RBF networks: Radial Basis Function networks use a set of input-output mappings defined by a non-linear function called the radial basis function. RBF networks are good for interpolation in low-dimensional spaces, but they're not commonly used for high-dimensional image classification tasks.\n\nBased on these brief explanations, the best architecture for classifying **high-resolution images** as of 2020 is:\n\n(A) convolutional networks (ConvNets).\n\nThis claim is supported by a large body of research and practical experience in the fields of computer vision and deep learning.

The algorithm operates by alternating between two steps: the E-step, where expected values are calculated, and the M-step, where model parameters are updated. The goal of the EM algorithm is to maximize the likelihood of the observed data.\n\nIt is generally true that the log-likelihood of the data will increase through successive iterations of the EM algorithm, as each iteration refines the estimates of the model parameters. However, this may not always be the case, as there can be instances where the likelihood may decrease or converge to a local maximum instead of a global maximum. In some cases, the EM algorithm may also get stuck in a suboptimal solution or fail to converge altogether, depending on the complexity of the model and the data.\n\nStatement 2: One disadvantage of Q-learning is that it can only be used when the learner has prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment.\n\nQ-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm thatlearnsto choose actions that maximize future rewards. It does not require prior knowledge about the environment dynamics; instead, it learns by interacting with the environment and updating its estimates of the expected future rewards associated with each action in each state.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Q-learning requires prior knowledge of how actions affect the environment is false.\n\nNow, to answer the question:\n(A) True, True\n(B) False, False\n(C) True, False\n(D) False, True\n\nThe correct answer is (C) True, False.

In this case, we have computed the gradient of the cost function and stored it in a vector g. The dimensions of the gradient vector depend on the number of parameters in the model (D) and the number of instances/examples in the training data (N).\n\n3.
