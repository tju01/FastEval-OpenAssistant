If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",

            "model_answer": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The limousine was bought for $98,000.\n2. The rental rate is $245 per hour.\n3. The car is estimated to be hired for 2 hours a day on average.\n4. Daily costs are about $50.\n5. We need to find the yearly yield if the limousine is rented every day of the year.\n\nFirst, let's find the daily revenue:\n\nDaily revenue = Rental rate x Hours rented\nDaily revenue = $245 per hour x 2 hours\nDaily revenue = $490\n\nNow, let's calculate the daily profit (after daily costs):\n\nDaily profit = Daily revenue - Daily costs\nDaily profit = $490 - $50\nDaily profit = $440\n\nSince we want to find the yearly yield, we need to calculate the total yearly profit and then divide it by the initial investment.\n\nYearly profit = Daily profit x Number of days in a year\nYearly profit = $440 x 365\nYearly profit = $16,060\n\nNow, we can find the estimated yearly yield:\n\nYearly yield = (Yearly profit / Initial investment) x 100\nYearly yield = ($16,060 / $98,000) x 100\nYearly yield = 0.1638 x 100\nYearly yield = 16.38%\n\nThe estimated yearly yield on the investment is 16.38%, which corresponds to option (A).",

This means that the assets on the balance sheet were understated.\n\nHowever, since the merchandise was purchased on credit, there should be a corresponding liability for the credit purchased merchandise. Since the purchase was not recorded in the accounting records, the liability was not recorded either.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's break down and analyze each of the statements about audit sampling risks for a nonissuer.\n\n(A) Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\n\nThis statement is talking about nonsampling risk, which is the risk that arises from factors other than the sample selection process. It is true that nonsampling risk can occur when an auditor tests only a sample of the population instead of testing all items, and thus, this statement is correct.\n\n(B) Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.\n\nThis statement is again talking about nonsampling risk. While it is true that nonsampling risk can arise due to auditor's failure to recognize misstatements, it is not the only reason for nonsampling risk. Moreover, this statement does not address the specific issue of sample selection, which is the main focus of the question.\n\n(C) Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.\n\nThis statement is talking about sampling risk, which arises from the use of samples instead of examining the entire population. It is true that sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks, and thus, this statement is correct.\n\n(D) Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.\n\nThis statement is again talking about sampling risk. However, it is not entirely correct, as it mixing sampling risk with audit risk (i.e., the risk that the auditor may unknowingly fail to modified auditor's report on financial statements that are materially misstated). Sampling risk is actually the risk that arises due to the use of samples, and it is quite different from audit risk.\n\nBased on the above analysis, statement (A) and statement (C) are both correct. However, the question asks for the single correct statement, and since statement (C) is more focused on the specific issue of sample selection, we should choose this statement as the correct answer.\n\nThe final line should contain the answer as a single letter with parenthesis without anything else:\n\n(C)",

Subsequent events refer to events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. The auditor needs to evaluate these events to determine their impact on the financial statements. Now let's examine each option:\n\n(A) Inspect inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end. \nAlthough inventory is a significant part of auditing, inspecting inventory items that arrived after the year end does not directly pertain to the auditor's responsibility regarding subsequent events.\n\n(B) Test internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate. \nInternal controls are important for auditing, but testing internal control activities does not necessarily involve subsequent events that occur after the balance sheet date.\n\n(C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end. \nBank statements provide crucial information regarding the organization's cash flow, and reviewing them after the year end can give the auditor insight into subsequent events that may have an impact on the financial statements.\n\n(D) Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited. \nInterim financial statements provide an overview of the organization's financial situation and can serve as comparative data for detecting any unusual transactions or trends that occurred after the balance sheet date.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.",
