Replace Ax with \"x is an apartment\": (\u2203x)[(Ax \u2022 Lx) \u2022 (\u2203y)(Hy \u2022 Bxy)] \u2192 (\u2203x)[(x is an apartment \u2022 Lx) \u2022 (\u2203y)(Hy \u2022 Bxy)]\n2.

Check the first part: \"(x is an apartment \u2022 x is large)\" - this says that x is both an apartment and large, which is impossible since x can only be either an apartment or a house. The proposition is contradictory and cannot have a valid English interpretation.\n\nHowever, I recognize that the question provides four answer choices and expects one of them to be selected. I will analyze the answer choices in the same way as the proposition:\n\nAnswer (A): (\u2203x)[(x is an apartment \u2022 x is large) \u2022 (\u2203y)(x is a house \u2022 x is larger than y)] - this is the same contradiction as above, so it cannot be the correct interpretation.\n\nAnswer (B): (\u2203x)[(x is an apartment \u2022 x is large) \u2022 (\u2203y)(x is a house & x is larger than y)] - same contradiction as above, so it cannot be the correct interpretation.\n\nAnswer (C): (\u2203x)[(x is an apartment & x is large) \u2022 (\u2203y)(x is a house & x is larger than y)] - (x is an apartment & x is large) is still a contradiction, so it cannot be the correct interpretation.\n\nAnswer (D): (\u2203x)[(x is an apartment & x is large) \u2022 (\u2203y)(x is a house & x is larger than y)] - again, same contradiction as above, so it cannot be the correct interpretation.\n\nNone of the answer choices can avoid the contradiction since they all imply x is both an apartment and large.
