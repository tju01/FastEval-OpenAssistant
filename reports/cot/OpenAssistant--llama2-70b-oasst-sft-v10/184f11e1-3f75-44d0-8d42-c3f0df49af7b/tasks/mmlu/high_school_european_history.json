            "model_answer": "Let's analyze the passage step-by-step:\n\n1. Huxley translated the term \"Protoplasm\" to \"the physical basis of life\" to make the title generally intelligible. This statement suggests that Huxley is discussing the physical, rather than supernatural or non-material, aspects of life.\n2. He then mentions that many people have the conception of life as something that works through matter. This statement implies that people tend to see life as a force that affects matter.\n3. However, Huxley challenges this common view by stating that the matter of life breaks down into ordinary matter, such as carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds, which possess no special properties beyond those of regular matter.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that Huxley rejected the notion of life as a force or as a supernatural phenomenon. He also did not explicitly define life as a philosophical notion. Instead, he argued that the matter of life forms ordinary matter with no special properties.\n\nBased on this information, the best answer would be:\n\n(C) merely a property of a certain kind of matter",

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him.

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\n\n(A) De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\n(B) Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\n(C) Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\n(D) De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.",

Columbus's goal in writing this letter is to present a favorable view of the situation in the New World and to justify his actions as an explorer and leader.\n\n2. De las Casas's account is from \"A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies,\" written in 1542. De las Casas describes the Spaniards as brutal and exploitative, killing and enslaving the native population in their quest for gold.

De las Casas's account is about the mistreatment of the native population, not the start of African slavery.\n\n(B) Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\n- This option is plausible, as Columbus's account seeks to present a favorable view of his actions and the situation in the New World. His description of the interactions with the natives may be skewed to support his narrative.\n\n(C) Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\n- This option is possible, as the time difference between the two accounts (1493 vs. 1542) could indicate a change in the treatment of the natives by the Spanish settlers. However, it does not explain why Columbus would portray the natives in a positive light while De las Casas described their mistreatment.\n\n(D) De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.\n- This option is not consistent with De las Casas's goal, as his account seeks to reform Spanish policies towards the natives, rather than advocating for the Spanish to leave the Americas altogether.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best explanation for the differences in the interactions between the Spaniards and the natives is:\n\n(B) Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.",
