However, they have also been used to engage in _______.\n\n(A) Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime\n(B) Traditional currency, Cheap, Unsecure, Charitable giving\n(C) Cryptocurrencies, Cheap, Secure, Financial crime\n(D) Traditional currency, Expensive, Unsecure, Charitable giving",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Let's analyze each line and compare it to the given options:\n\n1. \"such as bitcoin are becoming increasingly mainstream\"\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency, so the statement is talking about cryptocurrencies. This eliminates option B, which talks about traditional currency.\n\n2. \"and have a whole host of associated ethical implications\"\nThis line is a general statement about the subject (cryptocurrencies) and does not provide specific characteristics. Therefore, we cannot draw any conclusions from this line about the options.\n\n3. \"for example, they are______ and more ______.\"\nThis line describes cryptocurrencies as being \"expensive, secure\". Option A has \"Expensive, Secure\" which matches these characteristics. Option C also has \"Cheap, Secure\" but \"cheap\" does not match the current situation of cryptocurrencies, making it unlikely.\n\n4. \"However, they have also been used to engage in _______.\"\nThis line is describing a negative aspect of cryptocurrencies. Option A has \"Financial Crime\", which is indeed a problem associated with cryptocurrencies. Option C has \"Financial crime\" as well, but since we already eliminated it, we can ignore this match. Option B has \"Charitable giving\", which is not a negative aspect. Option D has \"Charitable giving\" as well, but since we already eliminated it, we can ignore this match.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the correct answer is:\n(A) Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime",

            "question": "Typical advertising regulatory bodies suggest, for example that adverts must not: encourage _________, cause unnecessary ________ or _____, and must not cause _______ offence.\n\n(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial\n(B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious\n(C) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial\n(D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "We are looking for the most appropriate phrasing to complete the sentence about what adverts must not do according to typical advertising regulatory bodies. Let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial - This option seems to suggest that adverts should not encourage unsafe practices, cause unnecessary wants or fear, and should not cause trivial offence. However, the word \"trivial\" does not seem appropriate here as offence should not be caused regardless of severity.\n\n(B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious - This option is more appropriate as it states that adverts should not encourage unsafe practices, cause unnecessary distress or fear, and should not cause serious offence. Distress and fear are similar but distinct concepts that are both appropriate to include. Serious offence is a more specific and appropriate term than just \"offence\".\n\n(C) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial - This option is not appropriate because it suggests that adverts should not promote safe practices, which would be counterintuitive for regulatory bodies. It also includes wants instead of distress or fear, and still uses the term \"trivial\" for offence.\n\n(D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious - Similar to option C, this option is also not suitable as it advises against promoting safe practices and replaces fear with jealousy. Additionally, serious offence is more specific and appropriate than just offence.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n(B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious",

This option does not describe the obligations of workers towards their employer.\n(B) Employee rights: This is the same as option A and, therefore, also not the correct answer.\n(C) Employer duties: This term refers to the obligations of employers towards their employees, not the other way around.

This option doesn't align with the idea of a ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities.\n\n(B) Absenteeism: This refers to the act of being absent from work, either for scheduled reasons or unscheduled reasons. This option also doesn't align with the idea of a ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities.\n\n(C) Work-play balance: This option is close, but \"play\" is not a commonly used term in the context of work-life balance. This option is not the standard term used in this context.\n\n(D) Work-life balance: This term refers to the \u00e9chelle between an individual's work and personal life, and it has become a hotly contested issue in recent years due to factors such as intensification of work and technological shifts.

The second blank is about one party gaining more from the relationship. This is related to the benefits gained by the parties in the collaboration.\n\n3. The third blank is about CSOs being misled or deceived in this collaboration. \n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) Power imbalance, Benefits, Hoodwinked: This option describes the situation where a power imbalance leads to one party possessing more resources and the other gaining more benefits, and \"hoodwinked\" means being deceived or tricked, so it fits the third blank.\n(B) Power imbalance, Resources, Co-opted: This option suggests that a power imbalance leads to one party holding more resources, and that this leads to the other party being \"co-opted,\" or influenced and controlled, which doesn't fit as well as \"hoodwinked.\"\n(C) Informational asymmetries, Benefits, Hoodwinked: Informational asymmetries refer to unequal access to information, which can lead to unfair advantage. This doesn't fit the first blank and \"hoodwinked\" still fits the third blank.\n(D) Informational asymmetries, Resources, Co-opted: This option suggests that informational asymmetries lead to one party having more resources and the other being co-opted.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to evaluate the similarities between corporate profit maximization and each of the normative theories listed.\n\n(A) Hedonistic utilitarianism: This theory states that the morally correct action is the one that produces the most pleasure and the least pain for the greatest number of people. Corporate profit maximization focuses on increasing profits for shareholders, which may not necessarily align with maximizing overall societal pleasure and minimizing pain.\n\n(B) Preference utilitarianism: This theory states that the morally correct action is the one that satisfies the greatest number of preferences. Corporate profit maximization aims to satisfy the preferences of shareholders, but it doesn't necessarily take into account the preferences of other stakeholders such as employees, customers, or the community.\n\n(C) The Categorical Imperative: This is a moral principle proposed by Immanuel Kant that states that an action is moral if and only if it can be willed as a universal law. Corporate profit maximization, as a general principle, doesn't necessarily meet this criterion since it could lead to negative consequences for society if it's pursued at the expense of other moral considerations.\n\n(D) Ethics of care: This theory emphasizes the importance of care, empathy, and relationships in moral decision making. Corporate profit maximization, on the other hand, focuses on financial outcomes and may not prioritize the well-being of individuals or communities.\n\nBased on this analysis, corporate profit maximization is most similar to (A) hedonistic utilitarianism, as both focus on maximizing a specific outcome (profit vs. pleasure) for a group of people (shareholders vs. society). However, it's important to note that there are still significant differences between the two and that this comparison is based on the given options.",

In this essay, he argued that the primary responsibility of businesses is to its shareholders, and that managers should act in ways that maximize profit. He believed that businesses should not engage in social or political activities beyond what is necessary to further their own interests.\n\nGiven this information, the closest answer to Friedman's beliefs is:\n\n(A) The only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders.",
