            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "We will examine each of these factors one by one.\n\n(A) BEING AFRICAN OR HISPANIC AMERICAN:\nSome studies have shown that African Americans and Hispanic Americans have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease compared to Caucasian Americans, so this factor is not associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's.\n\n(B) EATING FISH:\nThere is some evidence to suggest that a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, may be associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease. So this factor could be associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's.\n\n(C) A LOWER LEVEL OF EDUCATION:\nA higher level of education is generally associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, a lower level of education would not be associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's.\n\n(D) BEING MARRIED:\nSome studies have suggested that being married may be associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease, possibly due to the social and emotional support provided by a spouse. However, the evidence on this is not entirely consistent, and more research is needed.\n\nBased on the available evidence, the factor that is most strongly associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's is (B) EATING FISH.",

However, it does not specifically relate to docility, which refers to the level of obedience or compliance with those environmental demands.\n\n(B) Those who experience high environmental demands become more docile: This statement aligns with the docility hypothesis, as it suggests that individuals who face high environmental demands become more compliant or obedient in response to those demands.\n\n(C) Those who experience high environmental demands become less docile: This statement goes against the docility hypothesis, as it suggests that individuals who face high environmental demands become less compliant or obedient in response to those demands.\n\n(D) Those with less capability are less vulnerable to environmental demands: This statement contradicts option (A), suggesting that individuals with lower capabilities are less likely to be affected by their environment.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, I will analyze each of the given options and their potential effects on normal memory improvement.\n\n(A) Aerobic exercise: Multiple studies have shown that regular aerobic exercise can improve memory and cognitive function. Exercise has been shown to increase blood flow to the brain, improve brain health, and promote the release of growth factors that support the survival and growth of new brain cells.\n\n(B) Taking acetylcholine: Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in memory and learning. However, taking acetylcholine directly as a supplement is not effective, as it cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Some substances, like choline and lecithin, can be converted into acetylcholine in the body, but there is limited evidence that taking these supplements directly improves memory.\n\n(C) Taking gingko: Ginkgo biloba is a popular supplement that is often touted as a memory enhancer. However, the evidence on its effectiveness is mixed. Some studies suggest that it may improve memory in older adults, while other studies show no significant benefits. The potential benefits of ginkgo are likely modest at best.\n\n(D) Increasing social contacts: Social engagement and interaction can have positive effects on cognitive health, including memory. Engaging with others can stimulate the brain, provide opportunities for learning and problem-solving, and reduce the risk of social isolation, which has been linked to cognitive decline.\n\nBased on the available evidence, the best answer seems to be:\n\n(A) Aerobic exercise",

Both nature (genetics) and nurture (environment) are known to play important roles in shaping human behavior, so this option is a good fit for the statement.\n\n(B) Mechanistic vs. organismic: This is a debate about whether organisms should be viewed as machines or as wholes. The mechanistic view focuses on individual parts of an organism, while the organismic view sees the organism as a whole. The statement \"both play an important role\" does not seem to apply to this dichotomy, so this option is not the right answer.\n\n(C) Continuity vs. discontinuity: This is a debate about whether development is gradual and continuous or characterized by sudden changes.

This is a natural aging process and does not usually affect vision significantly.\n\n(C) It becomes clouded: A clouded lens is a symptom of cataracts, which are a common age-related eye condition that can cause vision problems and eventually require surgery to remove the clouded lens.\n\n(D) It fills with fluid: While the lens is surrounded by fluid (the aqueous humor), it generally does not fill with fluid as one grows older.\n\nBased on this information, the answer is (D) It fills with fluid.
