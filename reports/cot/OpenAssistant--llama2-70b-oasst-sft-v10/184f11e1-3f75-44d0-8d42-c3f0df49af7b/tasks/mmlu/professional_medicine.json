            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we should review the information given and examine each option to see which is most likely the cause of the patient's decreased sensation.\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization - There is no mention of any neurological symptoms or findings that would suggest a cerebral infarction. Additionally, it is not clear how this would cause decreased sensation in the left thigh.\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement - While it's possible that there could have been complications from the IVC filter placement, there is no evidence in the given information suggesting that this has caused the decreased sensation in the left thigh.\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve - This option seems plausible, given that the decreased sensation is in a specific area of the left thigh, which could be due to compression of the nerve supplying that area.\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh - The patient had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital, but there is no mention of any ongoing symptoms or findings that would suggest the hematoma is still causing problems. Additionally, the hematoma is not located in the same area where the decreased sensation is present.\n\nBased on the information provided and the process of elimination, the most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation is:\n\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.",

            "question": "A 25-year-old gravida 3 para 2 female is admitted to the hospital at 39\u00a0weeks' gestation in active labor. She had been having regular contractions every 4\u00a0minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6\u00a0hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100%\u00a0effaced and 7\u00a0cm dilated. The most likely diagnosis is\n\n(A) Braxton Hicks contractions\n(B) lower uterine retraction ring\n(C) hypotonic uterine dysfunction\n(D) primary dysfunctional labor",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze the given information and eliminate the options that don't fit the scenario.\n\nThe patient is gravida 3 para 2, which means she has had 3 pregnancies and 2 live births. She is currently at 39 weeks' gestation and in active labor. The contractions are currently weak and intermittent, but she has had regular contractions every 4 minutes earlier. She has received pain medication twice in the last 6 hours. The examination shows no obstructed labor, fetal head engagement, intact membranes, normal fetal heart tones, and a fully effaced and 7 cm dilated cervix.\n\nNow let's examine each of the answer options:\n\n(A) Braxton Hicks contractions: Braxton Hicks contractions are irregular, unpredictable contractions that occur throughout pregnancy. They are usually not as strong or frequent as true labor contractions and don't lead to cervical dilation or effacement. Since the patient is in active labor with cervical changes, this option is unlikely.\n\n(B) lower uterine retraction ring: A lower uterine retraction ring is a complication that can occur after a cesarean section. It is not associated with the patient's current labor situation. Therefore, this option is not relevant.\n\n(C) hypotonic uterine dysfunction: Hypotonic uterine dysfunction occurs when the uterus doesn't contract strongly enough to push the baby out during labor. Given that the patient's contractions have become weak and intermittent, this option seems like a plausible diagnosis.\n\n(D) primary dysfunctional labor: Primary dysfunctional labor refers to a situation where labor does not progress normally, despite no identifiable cause. Since the patient's examination shows no obstructed labor, this option is somewhat vague and less likely than option (C).\n\nBased on the available information and reasoning, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n(C) hypotonic uterine dysfunction",

His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo (p=0.04). Which of the following is the most appropriate interpretation of these study results?\n\n(A) The findings are clinically and statistically significant\n(B) The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant\n(C) The findings are clinically significant but statistically insignificant\n(D) The findings are neither clinically nor statistically significant",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, let's look at the p-value, which is 0.04. This means there is a 4% chance that the observed difference between the two groups is due to chance alone. Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we can consider the results statistically significant.\n\nNow, let's compare the mean time for resolution of symptoms. Patients receiving the new drug had a mean time of 6.4 days, while patients receiving the placebo had a mean time of 6.7 days. This means that patients receiving the new drug experienced a faster resolution of symptoms, although the difference was only 0.3 days (approximately 7 hours). \n\nConsidering the small difference in symptom resolution time and the p-value of 0.04, we can conclude that the findings are statistically significant but clinically insignificant.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate interpretation of these study results is:\n\n(B) The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant",

During this period, she has had tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger. The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of which of the following on the right?\n\n(A) Median nerve at the wrist\n(B) Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm\n(C) Radial nerve at the forearm\n(D) Ulnar nerve at the elbow",

The woman's symptoms do not include numbness or tingling in the thumb, index finger, or middle finger. Therefore, the median nerve is unlikely to be the cause.\n\n(B) Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm: The musculocutaneous nerve supplies the biceps muscle and skin over the lateral forearm and elbow. The woman's numbness and decreased sensation are not limited to these areas, so this nerve is also an unlikely cause.\n\n(C) Radial nerve at the forearm: The radial nerve supplies the triceps muscle, wrist extensors, and skin on the back of the hand and forearm. The woman's symptoms do not include numbness or tingling on the back of her hand or forearm or any problems with her wrist extensors, so the radial nerve is unlikely to be the cause.\n\n(D) Ulnar nerve at the elbow: The ulnar nerve supplies the hand muscles, medial forearm muscles, and skin over the medial hand and wrist. The woman's symptoms, including numbness, tingling, and decreased sensation, align with the areas supplied by the ulnar nerve. Additionally, the pain in the right ring and small fingers during elbow palpation suggests compression of the nerve at that site.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely cause of the woman's symptoms is entrapment of the:\n\n(D) Ulnar nerve at the elbow",
