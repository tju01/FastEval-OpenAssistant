            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, we'll examine what nearsightedness is and what causes it.\n\nNearsightedness, also known as myopia, is a refractive error where people can see nearby objects clearly, but objects farther away are blurry. This occurs when light entering the eye fails to focus correctly on the retina, which is responsible for detecting light and sending visual signals to the brain.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) Too much curvature of the cornea and lens: The cornea and lens are responsible for bending (refracting) light that enters the eye. If the curvature of these structures is too great, it causes the light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it, leading to nearsightedness.\n\n(B) Too little curvature of the cornea and lens: If the curvature of the cornea and lens is insufficient, light will focus behind the retina instead of directly on it, resulting in farsightedness (hyperopia).\n\n(C) Too much curvature of the iris and lens: The iris is the colored part of the eye and isn't involved in focusing light. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n(D) Too little curvature of the iris and lens: As previously mentioned, the iris is not involved in focusing light, so this option is also incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n(A) too much curvature of the cornea and lens\n\nNearsightedness results from (A) too much curvature of the cornea and lens.",

Delusions of grandeur are a common symptom of schizophrenia.\n\n(C) Conversion Disorder: This disorder is characterized by physical symptoms that are caused by psychological distress, but not by delusions of grandeur.\n\n(D) Antisocial Personality Disorder: This disorder is characterized by a lack of empathy, manipulative behavior, and disregard for social norms, but not delusions of grandeur.\n\nBased on this analysis, the mental disorder most characteristic of delusions of grandeur is:\n\n(B) schizophrenia.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To find the correct answer, let's analyze each of the given options in relation to Abraham Maslow's ideas about the priority of motives in relation to survival:\n\n(A) Homeostatic regulation: This refers to the body's natural ability to maintain a stable internal environment. Although important for survival, it is not directly related to Maslow's theory on the hierarchical organization of human needs.\n\n(B) Goal-setting: This refers to the process of identifying and working towards achieving specific objectives. While goal-setting can be important in human motivation, it does not specifically address the hierarchical organization of human needs and their priority in relation to survival.\n\n(C) Expectancy-value: This refers to the relationship between the perceived likelihood of achieving a goal (Expectancy) and its perceived value (Value) in motivating human behavior. Although this concept is relevant to human motivation, it does not directly address the hierarchical organization of human needs and their priority in relation to survival.\n\n(D) Hierarchy of needs: Maslow proposed a hierarchy of human needs that is organized from those fundamental to survival, such as physiological needs and safety, to those related to self-actualization. The most basic needs, or the ones necessary for survival, take priority over higher-order needs until they are satisfied. This concept aligns with the description that some motives are more imperative to survival than others.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the answer would be:\n(D) Hierarchy of needs",

Riles is a 1979 U.S. Supreme Court case that held that states must provide students with disabilities a free and appropriate public education at their own expense, rather than relying solely on federal funding. This ruling is indeed related to the provision of a free, appropriate public education for students with disabilities.\n\n(B) The provision of bilingual education for English-language learners is a separate issue from the precedent established in Larry P. v. Riles.\n\n(C) While the ruling in Larry P. v. Riles does mention the importance of not discriminating against students with disabilities in testing, the primary focus of the case refers to the financial responsibility of states in providing special education services.\n\n(D) The assignment of similar funding to athletic activities for boys and girls is not related to the precedent established in Larry P. v.

In other words, it tells us how much of the variation in a trait is inherited from our parents.\n\nIn the case of a cloned population, all individuals are genetically identical, meaning there are no genetic differences between them. As a result, any variation in traits within the population must be due to factors other than genetics, such as environmental influences or random chance.\n\nSince genetic differences do not contribute to variation in traits in a cloned population, the heritability for traits in such a population is:\n\n(A) 0%",

It too does not describe the spread.\n\nStep 3: Compare remaining options\nWe have variance and range left. Both of these describe the dispersion of data.\n\n- Range: It is the difference between the highest and lowest scores. It is straightforward to calculate but not sensitive to small variations, and it can be affected by outliers.\n- Variance: It measures the average distance between the scores and the mean.
