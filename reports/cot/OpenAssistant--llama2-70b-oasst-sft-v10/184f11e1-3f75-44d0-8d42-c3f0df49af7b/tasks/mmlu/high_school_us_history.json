While this act may have had some impact on immigrants, it was not explicitly designed to favor native-born citizens over immigrants.\n(B) The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798: These acts were passed during a time of political unrest and authorized the deportation of aliens considered dangerous to the country. This legislation can be seen as an example of nativism, as it targeted immigrants and aimed to protect native-born citizens.\n(C) The Espionage Act of 1917: This act criminalized the interference with the U.S. military or the production of war materials during World War I. While it may have had some impact on immigrants, it was not explicitly designed to favor native-born citizens over immigrants.\n(D) The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965: This act abolished the national origin quota system for immigration and created a system based on family reunification and skills.

While Washington did warn against the influence of political parties in his farewell address, there is no evidence to suggest that he reluctantly accepted the endorsement of the Federalist party.

After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first analyze the motivations and goals of each of these ideologies:\n\n(A) The Social Gospel: This movement emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Its leaders aimed to apply Christian ethics to social problems, especially issues related to poverty and social justice. Their goal was to create a more equitable society based on Christian values of compassion, charity, and service to others.\n\n(B) Social Darwinism: This theory holds that human societies follows the same principles as natural selection in biology. It suggests that competition between individuals or groups leads to the survival of the fittest, and thus social inequality is a natural outcome. Social Darwinism is generally considered to be a justification for laissez-faire capitalism and minimal government intervention in social issues.\n\n(C) Communism: This ideology advocates for the equal distribution of resources and a classless society. Property and means of production would be owned by the state or collectively by the people, with the goal of creating economic equality and social justice. While this may seem similar to Social Gospel in some ways, communism involves more radical measures, including the overthrow of existing systems of government and property ownership, and the establishment of a completely planned economy.\n\n(D) The Support of an Urban Political Machine: This refers to support for a political organization focused on winning and maintaining power in urban areas. This type of a machine typically relies on patronage, corruption, and the manipulation of voters, and its primary motivation is political power rather than social reform or justice.\n\nNow, let's consider the information given in the excerpt from Jane Addams' Twenty Years at Hull House. The text describes a settlement house providing support to working girls during a strike. The goal seems to be improving the lives of these individuals through collective action and mutual aid, without necessarily challenging the existing social or economic order. The focus is on creating community solutions rather than relying on government intervention or radical revolutionary change.\n\nBased on this, the most likely motivation for a settlement house worker would be (A) The Social Gospel. This ideology aligns closely with the goals and actions described in the text, emphasizing Christian values of compassion, service to others and creating a more equitable society through community action.",
