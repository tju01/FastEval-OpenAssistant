However, this can be addressed using optimization techniques like sparse matrices or hashing. Additionally, clumsiness in management might not be a critical difficulty in practical implementations.\n\n(B) The access matrix approach explicitly defines the access rights for every subject-object pair. Although it may require additional mechanisms for complex requirements, it is still capable of expressing them. It can represent complex relationships by combining multiple simpler matrices or using more advanced models.\n\n(C) Decidability means whether access decisions can be made in a finite number of steps. The access matrix approach involves looking up the matrix for a given subject-object pair, which is a finite step process. Therefore, it is decidable.\n\n(D) The access matrix approach should allow subjects, such as privileged processes or administrators, to modify access rights. By including additional rows or columns for these subjects in the matrix, it can establish change permissions. So, there is a way to express the ability to modify the access matrix.\n\nBased on the analysis, option (A) is the most reasonable difficulty associated with the access matrix approach.\n\nAnswer: (A)",
