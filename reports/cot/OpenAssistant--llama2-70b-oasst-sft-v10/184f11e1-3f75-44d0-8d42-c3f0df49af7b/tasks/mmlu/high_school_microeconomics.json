This is the point of economic profit maximization, as a firm will produce where its marginal revenue equals its marginal cost.\n\n(C) Marginal product is at its highest point.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between the price of labor and capital, their marginal products, and the firm's goal of maximizing profit.\n\n1. The price of labor is $2, and the price of capital is $1. This means that the firm could hire twice as much labor as capital for the same cost.\n\n2. The marginal product of labor is 200, and the marginal product of capital is 50. This means that each additional unit of labor would produce 200 units of output, while each additional unit of capital would produce 50 units of output.\n\n3. The firm's goal is to maximize profit, which it can do by equating the marginal product of labor with the marginal product of capital. This is known as the rule of cost minimization, which states that a firm should use the combination of inputs that produces the lowest total cost for a given level of output.\n\nIn this case, the firm should:\n\n(D) Decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of capital falls and the marginal product of labor rises.\n\nThis is because, by decreasing capital and increasing labor, the firm can produce the same amount of output at a lower cost, as the price of labor is lower than the price of capital. When the marginal product of labor is higher than the marginal product of capital, it is advantageous for the firm to use more labor and less capital.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the relationship between goods X and Y given the cross-price elasticity of +2.0, let's go through each of the options step-by-step:\n\n(A) Normal goods: A positive cross-price elasticity does not necessarily mean that the goods are normal goods. Normal goods have a positive income elasticity, meaning that demand for the good increases when income increases. However, cross-price elasticity measures the relationship between the prices of two goods, not their relationship with income.\n\n(B) Inferior goods: An inferior good has a negative income elasticity, meaning that demand for the good decreases when income increases. Again, this does not relate to cross-price elasticity.\n\n(C) Complementary goods: Complementary goods are goods that are often consumed together and have a negative cross-price elasticity. An increase in the price of one good leads to a decrease in demand for the other good. Since we are given a cross-price elasticity of +2.0, which is positive, this means that goods X and Y are not complementary goods.\n\n(D) Substitute goods: Substitute goods are goods that can be used interchangeably and have a positive cross-price elasticity. An increase in the price of one good leads to an increase in demand for the other good. Given that we are told the cross-price elasticity between goods X and Y is +2.0, which is positive, this means that goods X and Y are substitute goods.\n\nThus, the correct answer is (D) goods X and Y are substitute goods.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first define externality. An externality occurs when the production or consumption of a good or service affects a third party who did not choose to be involved. This can be either positive (a positive externality) or negative (a negative externality).\n\nNow let's consider each option and assess whether it is the most accurate statement about externalities:\n\n(A) causes the equilibrium price to be artificially high: This could be true in the case of a positive externality, where the true social value of a good or service is higher than the private value. However, it is not always the case, as negative externalities could cause the equilibrium price to be artificially low. So this option is not universally true.\n\n(B) causes the equilibrium price to be artificially low: This could be true in the case of a negative externality, where the true social cost of a good or service is higher than the private cost. However, it is not always the case, as positive externalities could cause the equilibrium price to be artificially high. So this option is also not universally true.\n\n(C) exists when markets cannot reach equilibrium: While externalities can prevent markets from reaching equilibrium, they can also exist in markets that are in equilibrium. So this option is not universally true.\n\n(D) results in an equilibrium that does not maximize the total benefit to society: This statement is true in general. Externalities result in a misallocation of resources, as the social cost or benefit is not reflected in the private cost or benefit. This means that the equilibrium reached by the market is not necessarily the equilibrium that maximizes the total benefit to society.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most accurate statement is:\n\n(D) results in an equilibrium that does not maximize the total benefit to society",

Therefore, if collusive output levels increase, it would likely result in higher prices, which is consistent with government's aim to discourage collusion.\n\n(B) Consumer surplus falls as the price is driven downward.\nThis option suggests that collusion leads to lower prices, which is the opposite of what typically happens in collusion. When firms collude, they restrict output and raise prices, reducing consumer surplus.\n\n(C) Collusive output levels tend to decrease, driving the price down to competitive levels.\nAs mentioned previously, collusion typically leads to increased prices, not decreased prices. This option contradicts the negative impact that collusion has on competition and consumers.\n\n(D) Joint profit maximization costs society consumer surplus as the price rises above competitive levels.\nThis option is consistent with the consequences of collusion. When firms collude and maximize profits jointly, they restrict output and increase prices, reducing consumer surplus. The government would discourage this behavior to protect consumers and promote competition.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Joint profit maximization costs society consumer surplus as the price rises above competitive levels.",

When rival firms follow a price decrease, the demand curve for the oligopolist will be downward-sloping, as customers will be more attracted to the lower prices.\n2. However, when rival firms do not follow a price increase, the demand curve for the oligopolist will be less elastic, as customers will not have as many alternative options if they decide to raise prices.\n\nNow let's analyze each of the given options:\n\n(A) Perfectly horizontal demand curve: This would imply that the oligopolist's demand is completely insensitive to price changes, which is not the case in this scenario.\n\n(B) Highly inelastic demand curve: This would imply that customers are not very sensitive to price changes, making it easier for the oligopolist to increase prices without losing too many customers. This seems like a closer match to the description given.\n\n(C) Highly elastic demand curve: This would imply that customers are very sensitive to price changes and would switch to other options if the oligopolist raises prices.

A firm can earn short-run profits through various other means, such as cost reduction or increasing demand.\n\n(C) all sources of elastic demand: Elastic demand refers to the situation where the demand for a product changes significantly in response to changes in price. None of the given factors - patents, control of resources, economies of scale, and exclusive licenses - directly cause elastic demand.\n\n(D) all barriers to entry: Barriers to entry refer to factors that make it difficult for new firms to enter a market and compete with existing firms. Patents, control of resources, economies of scale, and exclusive licenses all create barriers to entry by making it more difficult for new firms to compete with established firms. For example, patents provide legal protection for a firm's technology, control of resources can limit access to key inputs, economies of scale allow firms to lower their costs as they produce more, and exclusive licenses grant a firm the sole right to produce a product or service.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is:\n(D) all barriers to entry",
