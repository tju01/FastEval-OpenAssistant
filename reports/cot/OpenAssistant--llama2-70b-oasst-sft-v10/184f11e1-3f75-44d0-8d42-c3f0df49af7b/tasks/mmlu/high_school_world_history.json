It stresses the importance of preserving peace, especially for the countries of Asia and Africa, as without peace, their independence and development will have little meaning.\n\n2. The passage calls for injecting the voice of reason into world affairs and mobilizing the spiritual, moral, and political strength of Asia and Africa for peace.\n\n3. The speaker emphasizes the potential power of unity among the 1.4 billion people of Asia and Africa.\n\nNow, let's match these points to the answer choices:\n\n(A) The formation of the non-aligned movement: This choice seems relevant, as the passage focuses on the unity and collective action of Asia and Africa, which aligns with the goals of the non-aligned movement.\n\n(B) Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation: While peace is a focus of the passage, it does not specifically address disarmament or nuclear non-proliferation.\n\n(C) The Green Revolution in agriculture: This choice is not relevant, as the passage does not mention agriculture or the Green Revolution.\n\n(D) Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology: This choice is partially relevant, as the passage does emphasize the power of unity among Asian countries. However, it also includes Africa, which makes this choice less accurate.\n\nBased on this analysis, the passage is most associated with:\n\n(A) The formation of the non-aligned movement.",

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value.

Instead, it states that Ghanian citizens greet the king by falling on their knees and sprinkling dust on their heads, which is a different practice.\n\n(C) While the king adorned himself with gold and jewels, there is no mention of the gold and jewels being from India or any other Asian country.\n\n(D) Lastly, the people in the king's court wore silk robes.
