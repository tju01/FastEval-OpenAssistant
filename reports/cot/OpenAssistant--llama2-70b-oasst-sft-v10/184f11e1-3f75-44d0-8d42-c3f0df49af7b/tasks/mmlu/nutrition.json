            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's consider the definition of prevalence, which is the proportion of a population found to be affected by a medical condition at a specific time.\n\n(A) If the incidence rate of the disease falls, this means that fewer new cases are occurring. However, prevalence considers the total number of affected individuals at a given time, not just new cases. So, if the incidence rate falls, prevalence will likely decrease, not increase.\n\n(B) If survival time with the disease increases, this means that people with the disease are living longer. However, this does not necessarily mean that more people are affected by the disease at any given time. So, this factor is unlikely to increase prevalence.\n\n(C) If recovery from the disease is faster, this means that people are getting better more quickly. This also means that they are not counted as affected by the disease for as long. As a result, prevalence is likely to decrease, not increase.\n\n(D) If the population in which the disease is measured increases, and all else is constant, this means that there are more people who could potentially be affected by the disease. Therefore, the total number of people affected by the disease at any given time (i.e., prevalence) is likely to increase.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is: (D) If the population in which the disease is measured increases.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "We need to analyze each statement and determine if they are correct based on known facts about flavonoids, isoflavonoids, provitamins, and carotenoids.\n\n(A) The flavonoid class comprises flavonoids and isoflavonoids.\nReasoning: Flavonoids are a group of plant pigments that are commonly found in fruits, vegetables, and herbs. There are different subclasses of flavonoids, including flavones, anthocyanins, flavanones, and isoflavones. Isoflavones are a subclass of flavonoids and are found in plants such as soybeans. Therefore, it is correct to say that the flavonoid class comprises flavonoids and isoflavonoids.\n\n(B) The digestibility and bioavailability of isoflavones in soya food products are not changed by processing.\nReasoning: Processing of soya food products can affect the digestibility and bioavailability of isoflavones. Heating, fermentation, and other processing methods can influence the structure and chemical properties of soy proteins and isoflavones, which in turn affects their absorption by the body. So, this statement is not correct.\n\n(C) \u00df-Carotene and lycopene can both act as provitamin A.\nReasoning: \u00df-carotene is a precursor to vitamin A, meaning that the body can convert it into active vitamin A (retinol) when needed. Lycopene, on the other hand, is not a provitamin A carotenoid and does not have vitamin A activity. So, this statement is not correct.\n\n(D) Carotenoids and flavonoids both belong to the polyphenol class.\nReasoning: Carotenoids and flavonoids are both groups of naturally occurring pigments in plants, but they are not the same thing and do not belong to the same class. Carotenoids are a class of pigments that include carotenes (such as \u00df-carotene) and xanthophylls, while flavonoids are a group of polyphenolic compounds that include flavones, anthocyanins, flavanones, and isoflavones. So, this statement is not correct.\n\nSo the answer is:\n(A) The flavonoid class comprises flavonoids and isoflavonoids. (A)",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the main causes of the obesity epidemic, we should evaluate each option and consider scientific evidence on the factors contributing to obesity:\n\n(A) Increased energy quantity/density and a more sedentary life-style:\nStudies have shown that consuming more calories than needed, often from high-energy-density foods, combined with a sedentary lifestyle, contributes to weight gain and obesity.\n\n(B) Decreased leisure time activity:\nInactivity and sedentary behavior are significant risk factors for obesity. Reduced leisure time activity levels can contribute to weight gain. Still, it is not the only factor, as dietary habits also play a crucial role.\n\n(C) Changes in genetic profiles:\nGenetics play a role in obesity, as some individuals are genetically predisposed to gain weight more easily than others. However, genetic factors alone cannot explain the obesity epidemic, as environmental and lifestyle factors also contribute significantly.\n\n(D) None of the options given is correct:\nThis option would mean that none of the factors listed contribute to the obesity epidemic. However, research indicates that a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors contribute to obesity, including the options listed (A, B, and C).\n\nConsidering the evidence, it is clear that both dietary habits (energy quantity/density) and lifestyle factors (sedentary behavior) contribute to the obesity epidemic. Additionally, genetic factors also play a role, though they alone do not explain the epidemic.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(A) Increased energy quantity/density and a more sedentary life-style",

It is not a major lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes, so we can eliminate this option.\n\n(B) Vitamin D: Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, but it is primarily known for its role in bone health and regulating calcium and phosphate levels in the body. It is not a major lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes, so we can eliminate this option.\n\n(C) Vitamin E: Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin and a major lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes. It helps protect cell membranes from damage caused by free radicals and plays a role in immune function. This could be the correct answer.\n\n(D) Vitamin K: Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin, but it is primarily known for its role in blood clotting and bone health.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To figure out which option(s) contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults, we should analyze each choice:\n\n(A) Reduced secretion of intrinsic factor: Intrinsic factor is a glycoprotein secreted by the stomach's parietal cells, which is essential for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the small intestine. A decrease in intrinsic factor production can lead to impaired vitamin B12 absorption, potentially causing a deficiency. Older adults may have a reduced secretion of intrinsic factor due to a decline in stomach acid production, which can increase the risk of vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\n(B) Atrophic gastritis: Atrophic gastritis is an inflammation of the stomach lining that can lead to a thinning of the gastric mucosa. This condition can impair the stomach's ability to produce hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor, which are both necessary for effective vitamin B12 absorption. Atrophic gastritis is more common in older adults and can contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\n(C) Helicobacter pylori infection: Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that can infect the stomach and cause chronic gastritis. This infection can lead to a decrease in stomach acid production and a reduction in intrinsic factor secretion. These factors can negatively affect vitamin B12 absorption and increase the risk of deficiency. Helicobacter pylori infection is more common in older adults, making it a potential contributor to vitamin B12 deficiency in this age group.\n\nBased on our analysis:\n(A) Reduced secretion of intrinsic factor contributes to vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults.\n(B) Atrophic gastritis contributes to vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults.\n(C) Helicobacter pylori infection contributes to vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) All of the above",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which hormone is thought to mediate the effect of obesity on the risk of endometrial cancer, let's consider each option step by step:\n\n(A) Testosterone: Testosterone is a male sex hormone, and although it plays a role in various health conditions, it is not the primary hormone associated with the development of endometrial cancer or its relationship with obesity.\n\n(B) Oestrogen: Oestrogen is a female sex hormone, and high levels of oestrogen are known to increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Obesity is also associated with increased levels of oestrogen in the body, which could explain the link between obesity and endometrial cancer.\n\n(C) Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1): IGF-1 is a hormone that plays a role in cell growth and division, and it has been implicated in the development of various cancers, including endometrial cancer. Obesity is known to increase levels of IGF-1 in the body, which could contribute to the increased risk of endometrial cancer.\n\n(D) Thyroxine: Thyroxine is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland that regulates metabolism, and it is not directly associated with the risk of endometrial cancer or obesity.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, both oestrogen (B) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (C) are hormones that are associated with both obesity and endometrial cancer. However, the primary hormone thought to mediate the effect of obesity on the risk of endometrial cancer is oestrogen (B), as it has a more direct link to the development of the cancer itself.\n\n(B) Oestrogen",

            "model_answer": "To begin with, let's discuss what metabolic demand for amino acids means. This concept refers to the body's need for amino acids to carry out various metabolic processes, including building and maintaining tissues, producing hormones and enzymes, and regulating various bodily functions.\n\nNow let's evaluate each of the given statements:\n\n(A) The assertion that the demand is solely supplied from the diet is incorrect, because, while diet is a significant source of amino acids, the body also recycles amino acids from the breakdown of endogenous proteins.\n\n(B) This statement is somewhat true, but not fully accurate. While the maintenance of protein turnover is one component of metabolic demand for amino acids, it does not encompass all aspects of this demand, as other processes also require amino acids.\n\n(C) This statement is more correct than the previous two, as it recognizes that the amino acid requirement is linked with the body's need for these acids to participate in different metabolic processes, some of which are irreversible and can be either obligatory or adaptive.\n\n(D) Stating that the demand is a fixed amount is inaccurate, as the body's requirement for amino acids can change based on factors like age, health status, physical activity levels, and other individual variables.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, we can conclude that the most accurate among the given statements is:\n\n(C) The metabolic demand involves consumption of amino-acids by a number of irreversible pathways and these are either obligatory or adaptive.\n(C)",
