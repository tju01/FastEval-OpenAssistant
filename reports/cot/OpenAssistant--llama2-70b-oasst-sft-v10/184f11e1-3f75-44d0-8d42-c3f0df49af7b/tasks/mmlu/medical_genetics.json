            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Let's go through the answer choices step-by-step:\n\n(A) Telomeres are repetitive sequences of DNA that protect the ends of chromosomes from damage and fusion. While telomeres play a role in Robertsonian translocations, fusion does not occur directly at the telomeres.\n\n(B) Centromeres are regions of DNA located at the center of each chromosome, and they are responsible for ensuring equal distribution of genetic material during cell division. They are not directly involved in Robertsonian translocations.\n\n(C) Histones are proteins that help package DNA into tightly coiled structures called chromosomes. While histones play a role in the overall structure of chromosomes, they are not directly involved in the fusion process of Robertsonian translocations.\n\n(D) In a Robertsonian translocation, fusion occurs at the ends of the long arms of two non-homologous chromosomes. This results in the loss of one set of telomeres and the formation of a single chromosome with a shortened length.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) ends of the long arms.",

We need to determine which of the given options best describes their function.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the options\n(A) types of DNA-binding proteins: Zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins both interact with DNA and can act as regulatory proteins.\n(B) involved in the control of translation: Translation is the process of producing proteins from the information encoded in mRNA. While zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins are involved in gene regulation, they are not directly involved in translation.\n(C) components of ribosomes: Ribosomes are the cellular structures that carry out translation. Zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins are not components of ribosomes.\n(D) part of the hemoglobin in blood cells: Hemoglobin is the protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells. Zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins are not part of hemoglobin.\n\nStep 3: Selecting the best answer\nBased on the analysis above, Option (A) types of DNA-binding proteins is the most accurate description of Zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins.\n\nAnswer: (A) types of DNA-binding proteins",

            "question": "If the frequency of males affected with an X-linked recessive condition in a human population is .10 (one in ten), what will be the expected frequency of affected females?\n\n(A) 0.01\n(B) 0.001\n(C) 0.02\n(D) 0.0001",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given the frequency of affected males in a human population and we need to find the expected frequency of affected females. This is an X-linked recessive condition, which means it is caused by a gene on the X chromosome. Males have one X chromosome, so they can only be affected if they inherit the affected X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, so they can only be affected if they inherit two affected X chromosomes.\n\nStep 2: Determine the frequency of carriers\nSince the frequency of affected males is 0.10, this means that 90% of males are not affected. Therefore, 10% of males are carriers of the affected X chromosome. This is because carriers do not show the trait, but they can pass on the affected X chromosome to their offspring.\n\nStep 3: Determine the frequency of affected females\nFor a female to be affected, she must inherit two affected X chromosomes. Since the frequency of carriers is 10% for males, this means that 90% of females are not carriers. Therefore, 10% of females are carriers of the affected X chromosome. Since carriers can pass on the affected X chromosome to their offspring, we can expect that 10% of the offspring of two carrier parents will be affected females.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the expected frequency of affected females\nSince the frequency of carriers in females is 10%, this means that the expected frequency of affected females is 10% of 10%, or 0.10 * 0.10, which equals 0.01.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n(A) 0.01",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, let's go through each option step-by-step and evaluate their possibilities.\n\n(A) Autosomal dominant: A condition is autosomal dominant if only one copy of the mutated gene from either parent is needed to have the disorder. Malignant hyperthermia is a rare disorder, but it is not typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.\n\n(B) Autosomal recessive: A condition is autosomal recessive if two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, are needed to have the disorder. Since malignant hyperthermia is a rare disorder, it is not likely to be autosomal recessive as carriers would be more common.\n\n(C) X-linked dominant: A condition is X-linked dominant if a mutated gene on the X chromosome from either parent is needed to have the disorder. Males have one X chromosome, so if they inherit the mutated gene, they will have the disorder. Females have two X chromosomes, so if they inherit one mutated gene, they will be carriers but not have the disorder. Malignant hyperthermia affects both males and females, but females are usually less severely affected. This suggests that it may be an X-linked dominant disorder.\n\n(D) X-linked recessive: A condition is X-linked recessive if a mutated gene on the X chromosome from both parents is needed to have the disorder. Males have only one X chromosome, so if they inherit the mutated gene, they will have the disorder. Females have two X chromosomes, so if they inherit one mutated gene, they will be carriers but not have the disorder. Malignant hyperthermia affects both males and females, so it is not likely to be X-linked recessive.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) X-linked dominant.",

While regulatory mutations can influence splicing, they are not specifically responsible for exon skipping.\n\n(C) RNA processing mutations: Exon skipping occurs during the process of RNA splicing, where mature mRNA molecules are generated by the joining together of specific regions (exons) and the removal of non-coding regions (introns).
