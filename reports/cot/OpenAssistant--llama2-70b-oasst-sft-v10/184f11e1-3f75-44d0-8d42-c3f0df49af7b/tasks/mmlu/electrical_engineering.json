This means that the potentiometer method can provide a more stable and accurate measurement compared to direct measurement using a voltmeter, which may be affected by voltage fluctuations in the circuit.\n\n(B) It loads the circuit to the maximum extent.\n- This statement is incorrect. The potentiometer method does not load the circuit to the maximum extent.\n\n(C) It uses center zero galvanometer instead of voltmeter.\n- The center-zero galvanometer is used in the potentiometer method to measure the voltage difference between two points in the circuit. While this may help to improve the accuracy of the measurement, it is not the primary reason why the potentiometer method is more accurate than direct measurement using a voltmeter.\n\n(D) It does not load the circuit at all.\n- This statement is incorrect.

Calculate the maximum and minimum firing angles.\n3. Compare the calculated firing angles with the given options and find the correct answer.\n\nStep 1: Determine the maximum and minimum values of the counter emf.\nThe load counter emf is given as E = 400 sin(314t). The maximum and minimum values of sin(314t) occur when t = 0 and t = \u03c0/314 respectively. Therefore,\nMaximum value of E = 400 sin(0) = 400 V\nMinimum value of E = 400 sin(\u03c0/314) \u2248 -344.37 V\n\nStep 2: Calculate the maximum and minimum firing angles.\nThe firing angle is the angle by which the source voltage leads or lags the load voltage. For a single-phase one-pulse controlled circuit, the firing angle (\u03b8) can be expressed as:\n\u03b8 = arctan(R/L * dI/dt)\nwhere R is the circuit resistance, L is the circuit inductance, and dI/dt is the rate of change of current.\nFor the maximum firing angle (\u03b8_max), we assume that the load voltage (E) is in phase with the source voltage. So, \u03b8_max = 0.\nFor the minimum firing angle (\u03b8_min), we assume that the load voltage is 180\u00b0 out of phase with the source voltage. To find this, we need to add or subtract 180\u00b0 from the maximum value of \u03b8. Since \u03b8_max = 0, \u03b8_min = -180\u00b0.\n\nStep 3: Compare the calculated firing angles with the given options and find the correct answer.\nUsing the firing angles calculated in step 2, the range of firing angle control is:\n\u03b8_min to \u03b8_max = -180\u00b0 to 0\u00b0\nHowever, none of the options given match this range.
