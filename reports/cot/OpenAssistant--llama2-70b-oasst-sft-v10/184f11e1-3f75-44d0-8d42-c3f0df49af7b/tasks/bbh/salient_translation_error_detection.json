Based on context and their specific meaning as types of classifications, \"Arten\" is closer to \"species\" while \"Gattungen\" is closer to \"genera\". Given this, the difference does not greatly change the overall meaning of the sentence even though they aren't the closest match and so isn't a perfect translation.\n\nGiven these considerations, none of the options perfectly apply, but B: Numerical Values is the closest option as the classification types are closer to being factually correct than the number which is clearly wrong. \n\nAnswer: (B) Numerical Values",
