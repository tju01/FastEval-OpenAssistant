This oversimplifies the complex nature of depression and mental health struggles. It implies that if a person is not happy, it is their fault for not choosing happiness, which is not an accurate or sensitive understanding of mental health issues.\n\n(B) \"Hey just be happy that you won't be depressed anymore\"\nThis statement seems to be acknowledging the positive outcome of no longer being depressed, implying that the person has already overcome depression. It may be a positive and supportive statement, encouraging the person to focus on the improvements in their mental health.\n\nBased on this analysis, statement (A) appears to be sarcastic, as it oversimplifies the complex nature of depression and mental health struggles, and implies that being happy is a simple choice someone can make to overcome depression.

Statement (A) has a more reasonable and common-sense approach to dealing with assault. On the other hand, statement (B) suggests a passive attitude towards assault, which is generally not advisable or expected.

Statement (A) implies that it's the first week of winter and that the weather will get warmer in a couple of weeks for a playoff game. This seems unlikely, as the weather tends to get colder during winter, not warmer.\n3. Statement (B) implies that it's the last week of winter and that the weather will get warmer in a couple of weeks for a playoff game. This is more plausible, as the weather tends to get warmer during the transition from winter to spring.\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems that Statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic, as it goes against the typical pattern of weather during winter.\n\nSo the answer is: (A)",

This is a reasonable assumption given the level of security one would expect at a government facility.\n\n(B) Sneaking out of a government facility with dangerous contraband isn't going to be illegal\nThis statement implies that sneaking out of a government facility with dangerous contraband is not against the law, which is clearly false. It goes against logic to assume that smuggling contraband out of a government facility would be legal.\n\nBased on the analysis, I can conclude that statement (B) is sarcastic.\n\nThe final line containing the answer as a single letter with parenthesis is: B",

It does not seem to carry a sarcastic tone.\n\n(B) Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight days ago: This statement implies that the speaker is happy that prices have not increased significantly over just eight days. However, it is highly unlikely that prices would remain the same for such a short period, making this statement seem sarcastic.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is (B).

Always glad to feed the elephants, that woefully endangered species.\n\n(B) You're welcome my dear friend. Always glad to feed the trolls, that woefully endangered species.\n\nFirst, let's consider the term \"endangered species.\" It is commonly used to refer to animals or plants that are at risk of extinction due to various factors.\n\nNext, let's examine each statement:\n\nIn statement (A), the speaker mentions \"feeding the elephants.\" Elephants are, in fact, a real animal species, and some of them are considered endangered. Therefore, the mention of elephants being an endangered species is not a sarcastic remark.\n\nIn statement (B), the speaker mentions \"feeding the trolls.\" In this context, \"trolls\" likely refers to an online term describing people who post deliberately provocative or inflammatory content. Trolls are not a real animal species and are not endangered. The use of the term \"endangered species\" in relation to trolls is meant to be humorous and ironic, as it is not a factually accurate statement.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that statement (B) is sarcastic.

Suggesting that someone is \"poor\" for receiving such a substantial scholarship is likely meant to be ironic.\n\n(B) What a poor guy, years of work and he only got a $50 scholarship\nThis statement is less likely to be sarcastic, as $50 is a relatively small amount of money compared to the effort that might have gone into earning the scholarship.

Assuming an average fuel price of $3 per gallon, this would make the fuel cost per mile range from $0.15 to $0.20. Thus, $0.15 per mile is a reasonable fuel cost for a van.\n\n(B) That's only about $10 per mile for a van, perfectly reasonable fuel costs\n\nUsing the same fuel efficiency and fuel price assumptions as above, $10 per mile would be an extremely high fuel cost for a van. This would equate to 66.67 gallons of fuel being consumed per mile, which is highly unlikely.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n(B) That's only about $10 per mile for a van, perfectly reasonable fuel costs\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n(B)",
