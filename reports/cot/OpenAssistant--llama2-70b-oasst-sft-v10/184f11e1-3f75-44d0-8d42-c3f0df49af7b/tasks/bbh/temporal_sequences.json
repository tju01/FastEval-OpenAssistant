Tiffany saw Betty fixing their computer at the electronic store (10 am - 1 pm)\n4. Susan saw Betty taking photos near the Eiffel Tower (1 pm - 2 pm)\n5. Betty saw Betty getting a coffee at the cafe (7 pm - 10 pm)\n6. The art show was closed after 10 pm\n\nNow, we need to find the time slot when Betty could have gone to the art show.\n\nFrom the given information, we can see that:\n\n- The art show must have been open when Betty went there, so the time slot should be before 10 pm.\n- Betty was not at the art show during the time when Elizabeth, Tiffany, or Susan saw her, so we can rule out the time slots from 8 am to 10 am, 10 am to 1 pm, and 1 pm to 2 pm.\n- This leaves us with the time slot from 2 pm to 7 pm and the time slot from 7 pm to 10 pm.\n\nHowever, we need to check if Betty had enough time to go to the art show during both of these time slots.\n\nBetween 2 pm and 7 pm, we know that:\n\n- Susan saw Betty at the Eiffel Tower from 1 pm to 2 pm. Since it would take some time for Betty to get from the Eiffel Tower to the art show, it is unlikely that Betty could have gone to the art show before 2 pm. So, this time slot is not feasible.\n\nBetween 7 pm and 10 pm, we know that:\n\n- Betty saw Betty getting a coffee at the cafe from 7 pm to 10 pm. It is possible that Betty went to the art show after getting coffee, and before the art show closed at 10 pm. So, this time slot is feasible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) 7pm to 10pm",
