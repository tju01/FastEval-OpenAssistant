            "model_answer": "To determine the correct adjective order for these sentences, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the noun in each sentence. In both options, the noun is \"surfboard.\"\n2. Determine the adjectives modifying the noun. In option (A), the adjectives are \"new,\" \"white,\" \"lead,\" and \"walking.\" In option (B), the adjectives are \"walking,\" \"lead,\" \"new,\" and \"white.\"\n3. Arrange the adjectives in the correct order according to standard English usage. Typically, adjectives come before the noun they modify and should be ordered as follows:\n\n quantitative (e.g., one, two, three)\n qualitative (e.g., red, blue, happy)\n size (e.g., big, small, tall)\n age (e.g., old, young, new)\n shape (e.g., round, square, triangular)\n color (e.g., red, blue, green)\n origin or material (e.g., French, wooden, cotton)\n purpose or qualifier (e.g., cooking, surfing, sleeping)\n\n4. Using the above order, we can arrange the adjectives in option (A) as: \"new white lead walking surfboard.\" However, this order does not seem to follow the standard English usage as it puts the material adjective \"lead\" after the age adjective \"new\" and before the color adjectives \"white\" and \"walking.\"\n5. Similarly, in option (B), the order of adjectives comes out to be \"walking lead new white surfboard.\" This order correctly places the age adjective \"new\" before the material adjective \"lead,\" the color adjective \"white,\" and the qualifier adjective \"walking.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the sentence with the correct adjective order is:\n(B) walking lead new white surfboard\nB",

Lastly, both sentences end with the adjective \"walking,\" which describes the subject's purpose or qualifier.\n\nUpon analyzing the two options, we can see that both follow the typical order of adjectives in English.\n\nHowever, if we had to choose the option that more closely follows the standard word order, we could say that:\n(B) mysterious ancient yellow walking cat\nis more common, as it places the adjective \"ancient\" before \"mysterious,\" which is usually placed before adjectives describing age.\n\nSo the answer is: B",
