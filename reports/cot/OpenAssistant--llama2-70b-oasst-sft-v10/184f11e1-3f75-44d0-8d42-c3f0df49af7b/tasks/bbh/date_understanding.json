To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from today's year i.e. 2019 - 1 = 2018. Then subtracting one month and seven days from today (January 7th, 2019) is the date we need.\n\n3. lead us to December 31st, 2018 - 7 = December 24th, 2018.

Subtracting one year again would then result in Valentine's day 2020 (February 14th 2020). \n\nIt's also important to note that if today was January 6th 2019 the result of the calculations would be an invalid date (January 6th 2018), and if today was January 1st 2019, the result would return December 25th 2017.",
