In mathematics, a space is said to be compact if it meets the Hausdorff condition, meaning that every open ball in this space is dense.\n\nNext, we need to determine whether every complete space is actually compact. We know this is true from the fact that a space is Hausdorff if it meets the condition that its balls have dense interiors.\n\nFinally, we can conclude that both (a) and (b) hold only if there exists
