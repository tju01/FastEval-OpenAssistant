In this case, the term UK Constitution may refer to the political system of the United Kingdom. Therefore, I will analyze each statement in turn:\n\n(A) This statement suggests that the sovereign is the sole source of power in the UK Constitution. However, this statement is incorrect because there are multiple sources of power that contribute to the functioning of the political system in the UK. These sources include the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and the Monarchy.\n\n(B) This statement suggests that the judiciary has the power to overturn acts of the UK Parliament. This statement is also incorrect because there are checks and balances that prevent the judiciary from overturning the decisions of the UK Parliament.\n\n(C) This statement claims that the UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources. This statement is largely correct, as there are many different sources that contribute to the UK Constitution, including the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and the Monarchy.\n\n(D) This statement claims that the UK Constitution is based on a Bill of Rights. This statement is largely correct as well, as many lawyers have stated that the UK Bill of Rights has been largely successful in installing these rights into the UK Constitution.\n\nTherefore, after analyzing all the statements in turn, we can conclude that there are multiple sources of power that contribute to the functioning of these systems in different ways, so it is difficult to choose a single best statement as many statements contribute differently to different aspects of the UK Constitution.",
