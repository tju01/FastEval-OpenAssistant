            "model_answer": "assistant\nWhich statement expresses the relationship between aging and sexual functioning depends on which aspects of sexual functioning are being referred to.\n\n(A) Aging is related to an increase in vaginal lubrication - This statement is true. As women age, there is often a reduction in the amount of vaginal lubrication produced.\n\n(B) Aging is associated with an increase in the frequency and number of orgasmic contractions in both sexes - This statement is false. Orgasms become less frequent with aging.\n\n(C) There is no significant relationship between aging and sexual responses in either sex - This statement is true. With aging, there can be changes in sexual responses.\n\n(D) Aging is related to some loss of erectile rigidity in the male - This statement is false. Erectile function does not change significantly with aging.\n\nThe correct answer depends on the aspects of sexual functioning that are being referred to.",

This involves talking with the undifferentiated British Psychological Society the most likely approach a family therapist would take is option B and to \"work initially with the most differentiated family member\". This involves talking with the most differentiated family member first about what they think the goal of the therapy should be. After talking with the most differentiated family member about the goal of therapy they will listen to one of the other family members to find out what they think the goal of therapy should be. Finally, they would listen to the therapist to determine the end of the period of counselling so the cost of the interviews with the most differentiated family member country. After the interviews have been translated into different languages the text will be translated into French and then only then read back in the original country. They will listen to the therapist and also ask the therapist the way they think the end of the counselling period would be helpful to them. The therapist would use their own scientific research and they would listen to the   goals to ensure they have a clear understanding of what is in the most differentiated.

They should challenge the therapeutic way, which is that it is scientific experimentation in the last condition, which is the last way to work. They should encourage other caregivers and try the dimension, which is also the most last way. The most important therapist's work is scientific experimentation in view of the fact that the components should be simplified into alternative ways.  The last thing the therapist's goal is to show that the scientific experiment in the fact that it considers the family therapist is important since he uses the therapy to work mainly with dependent aspects, or different components of the Interaction. They should challenge the sick caregiver, which is a great relief in sick caregivers and alternative components that are very important in the medical dimension.
