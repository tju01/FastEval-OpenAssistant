Mammography, on the other hand, is a screening test used in conjunction with needle biopsy and repeat biopsy to determine whether or not a patient has a malignant lesion and whether further action is necessary. In many cases, repeat biopsy reveals the presence of malignancy, and the patient may be advised to undergo repeat biopsies.\n\nBreast cancer is a common form of cancer in women and men, accounting for 1% of all cancers diagnosed. The most common symptoms include localised pain or bone pain; emotional abnormality e.G. prolonged sadness; and low back, hip; knee pains. Some of the symptoms include constipation and the appearance of seborrheic keratosis.",

Finally, I will synthesize my findings and present my final answer as a single letter with parenthesis.\n\nStep 1: Understanding Judaism's Stance on Sexuality\nJudaism teaches that sexuality is a sacred act, meant to bring one closer to God. In this context, sexuality can be seen as inherently good because it allows individuals to connect with the divine. However, sexuality is not without its problems; some people may have unhealthy attitudes towards sex or engage in selfish behavior that goes against Jewish values.\nStep 2: Exploring the Relationship between Sexuality and Spirituality\nIn Judaism, sexuality is often seen as a way to deepen spiritual connections with others and ultimately with God himself. Sexuality is viewed as an essential part of human existence that contributes to the overall spiritual well-being of humans and society at large. It is through embracing our sexual natures that we are able to have a deeper relationship with ourselves and ultimately with the divine.\nStep 3: Examining the Role of Sexuality in Jewish Culture\nIn Jewish culture, sexuality plays a key role in shaping and maintaining social norms, cultural traditions, and religious beliefs among Jews worldwide. As such, sexuality serves as a vital force within Jewish society, helping to construct and sustain Jewish cultural practices, identity, and community.\nFinal Answer: (C) a gift from God",
