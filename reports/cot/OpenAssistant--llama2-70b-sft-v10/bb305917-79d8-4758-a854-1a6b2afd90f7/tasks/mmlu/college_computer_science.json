These typically include an exponent, mantissa, and base value.\n\nStep2: Observe that some numbers, such as rational numbers, do not have an exact representation. This can be because these numbers are either irrational or transcendental.\n\nStep3: Recognize that there are upper and lower bounds on the size of numbers used in the arithmetic operation to ensure that the result is an exact representation of the original input.\n\nStep4: Anticipate the limitations of roundoff conventions and identify appropriate alternative roundoff conventions.
