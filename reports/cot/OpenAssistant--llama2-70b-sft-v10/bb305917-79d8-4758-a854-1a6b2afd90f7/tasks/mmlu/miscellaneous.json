The CTE of a material is a measure of how much its dimensions change with temperature. In general, the higher the CTE of a material, the less the material will expand when heated. This means that the higher the CTE of a material, the less the material will expand when heated.\n\nTherefore, if we take the CTE of the materials into consideration, we can say that Copper has the least CTE among all the materials listed. On the other hand, Germanium and Silicon both have relatively high CTE, but their CTE is affected more by temperature changes.\n\nTherefore, if we want to find a material that has a resistance that is LEAST affected by temperature changes, we should choose Copper. It has a very low CTE but is still able to maintain its shape and size when heated.
