Provide a final answer in a single letter with parenthesis at the end.\n\nStep 1: Research the economic impact of World War I on the United States and Europe.\n\nThrough my research, I have found that World War I had a significant economic impact on the United States and Europe. During the war, the United States became a major creditor, providing financial support to the Allies. At the same time, many European countries found themselves struggling financially due to the war. This led to a shift in economic power from Europe to the United States, giving the US a dominant role in the global economy.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the data collected in step 1.\n\nUpon analyzing the data collected in step 1, it is clear that the economic impact of World War I shifted economic power from Europe to the United States. This was primarily due to the United States becoming a major creditor, providing financial support to the Allies, and to the struggling European countries that found themselves in financial difficulties due to the war.\n\nStep 3: Draw conclusions based on the data analyzed in step 2.\n\nBased on this data, it is evident that the economic impact of World War I shifted economic power from Europe to the United States by making the US a major creditor while many European countries struggled financially as a result of the war.\n\nFinal answer: D.
