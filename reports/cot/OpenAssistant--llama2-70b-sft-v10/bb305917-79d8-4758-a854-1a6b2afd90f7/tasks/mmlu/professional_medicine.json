            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold.

            "question": "A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of numbness in her right hand. During this period, she has had tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger. The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of which of the following on the right?\n\n(A) Median nerve at the wrist\n(B) Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm\n(C) Radial nerve at the forearm\n(D) Ulnar nerve at the elbow",

            "model_answer": "assistant\nTo answer the question, let's go through the options one by one:\n\n(A) Median nerve at the wrist: Entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist could cause numbness and tingling in the right hand, but it's not the likely cause of the other findings.\n\n(B) Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm: Entrapment of the musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm could cause decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch in the right ring finger and the entire small finger. However, it can't explain the jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers.\n\n(C) Radial nerve at the forearm: Entrapment of the radial nerve at the forearm is likely to cause numbness and tingling, as well as jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers, but it can't explain the decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch.\n\n(D) Ulnar nerve at the elbow: Entrapment of the ulnar nerve at the elbow likely causes the jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers, and the decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch, can be explained by compression of the ulnar nerve. Compression of the ulnar nerve could cause numbness and tingling in the right hand. \n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of the ulnar nerve at the elbow.",

The patient did have high T4 levels, but these seem to have decreased over the years. There did appear to have been some sort of miscalculation as the result was reverse engineered after she was hospitalized.\n\n(B) Graves' disease - This is a condition in which the thyroid gland becomes enlarged and can result in difficulty swallowing. The patient presented multiple symptoms, including difficulty swallowing, heart palpitations, heat intolerance, and weight loss. However, the final diagnosis appears to be incorrect because she lost so much weight, and as originally calculated, there was reverse engineering involved after she was hospitalized.\n\n(C) Multinodular goiter - This is a condition in which the thyroid gland becomes enlarged and can result in difficulty swallowing. The patient presented multiple symptoms, including difficulty swallowing, heart palpitations, heat intolerance, and weight loss. However, the final diagnosis appears to be incorrect because she lost so much weight, and as originally calculated, there was reverse engineering involved after she was hospitalized.\n\n(D) Riedel's thyroiditis - This is inflammation of the thyroid gland that may cause it to become enlarged.
