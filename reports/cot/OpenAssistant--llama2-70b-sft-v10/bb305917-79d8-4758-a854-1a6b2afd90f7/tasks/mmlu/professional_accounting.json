            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "assistant\nTo solve this we first need to calculate the total revenue generated from renting out the limousine for weddings, ceremonies and parties. Assuming the limousine is rented out for 2 hours a day on average, the total revenue generated would be:\nTotal revenue = 2 x number of rentals per day x daily cost\n= (2 x 245) x number of rentals per day x daily cost\n= 2 x 245\n= 2 x 245\nSo the total revenue generated from renting out the limousine for weddings, ceremonies and parties would be $2 * 245 = $490.\nTherefore, the estimated yearly yield on your investment would be $245 * 2 * 365 / 100 = 164% ( answer A )",
