The statement is about a program being expressed in a programming language, but it does not specify which language.\n2. The statement implies that the program can be expressed in any programming language, not just binary code.\n3. The statement does not specify the version of the program or the operations being performed.\n\nBased on these hints, we can conclude that the statement \"A program is expressed in a programming language\" is true, regardless of the language used.
