Could you explain what each of these coding mistakes mean?\n(A) Memory leakage: This refers to a mistake where a developer inadvertently leaks memory by not freeing it properly after a program has finished running. Buff-overrun: This is another name for memory leakage that occurs when a program tries to write too much data to a buffer at once. Less processing power: This is a coding mistake made by developers that allows a program to use less processing power than necessary, resulting in slower performance or even crashes. Inefficient programming: This refers to a mistake where a developer writes code that is not optimized and thus leads to poor performance.",

            "question": "Consider the paper Native Client: A Sandbox for Portable, Untrusted x86 Native Code by Yee et al. Ben Bitdiddle notes that NaCl uses Intel x86 segmentation to ensure that the sandboxed module does not read or write memory outside its own data area, and does not execute instructions outside its own code. Ben thinks that with these restrictions alone, executing the sandboxed module must be safe; that is, he thinks validation is not needed. Ben is wrong. Circle the types of x86 machine instructions that the validator always forbids in sandboxed code. Please ignore trampoline and springboard code.\n\n(A) all instructions that modify segment state\n(B) all loads or stores to addresses that are not 0 mod 32\n(C) all indirect loads or stores (via an address in a register or variable)\n(D) all indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable)",

String boundary refers to checks made in the code to ensure that strings are properly formatted. When an application is developed in C or C++, the developer typically does not include code in the application itself for string boundary checks. This means that the application is vulnerable to buffer overflow.",
