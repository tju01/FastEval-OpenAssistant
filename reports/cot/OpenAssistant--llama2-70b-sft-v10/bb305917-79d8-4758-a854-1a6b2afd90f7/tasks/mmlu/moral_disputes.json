            "model_answer": "assistant\nTo answer your question, lets break down just war theory step by step.\n\nFirstly, the theory of just war focuses on the principle of military necessity. This means that if a state is involved in a war, it must have a just cause to do so. For example, if a state invades another state, it must have just cause to do so.\n\nSecondly, lets look at just war theory's principle of proportionality. Proportionality means that the harm caused to civilians should be proportional to the military advantage gained by attacking the enemy. In other words, if the enemy is defeated, then the harm caused to civilians would be less than if the enemy had won.\n\nFinally, lets examine just war theory's principle of double effect. Double effect means that the harm caused to civilians should be twice as great as the military advantage gained by attacking the enemy. In other words, if the enemy is defeated, then the harm caused to civilians would be twice as great as if the enemy had won.\n\nSo in conclusion, the theory of just war focuses on the principle of military necessity, the principle of proportionality, and the principle of double effect.\n\nIn this case, the final line should contain the answer as \"D all of the above\"",

            "model_answer": "assistant\nTo answer the question of which kind of retributivism Nathanson supports, we first need to understand what retributivism is. Retributivism refers to the idea of giving something back to society as a form of reparation for a wrong that has been done. It is often associated with the concept of restorative justice, which seeks to repair the harm done to the victim of a crime or wrongful act.\n\nPreventive retributivism focuses on preventing harm before it happens, whereas proportional retributivism looks at the harm that has already occurred and seeks to make it right. Equality retributivism is concerned with making sure that everyone is treated equally, regardless of their status as a victim or a perpetrator. Finally, retaliatory retributivism looks at the harm that has been done as a result of a crime or wrongful act and seeks to make the perpetrator pay for their actions.\n\nIn the case of Nathanson, he supports which of the following kinds of retributivism?\n\nPreventive\nProportional\nEquality\nRetaliatory\n\nBased on the information provided, Nathanson supports proportional retributivism.
