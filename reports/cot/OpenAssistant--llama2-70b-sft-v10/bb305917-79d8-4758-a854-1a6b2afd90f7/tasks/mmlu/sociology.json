Moreover, there was no growth in income inequality caused by any of the mentioned options in the 1980s. There was also a decrease in employment opportunities for certain occupational groups, which could have contributed to the decrease in wage inequality experienced in particular industries.\n\nThe last option \"D\", increasing dependence on welfare benefits due to growing unemployment, seems incoherent to me.
