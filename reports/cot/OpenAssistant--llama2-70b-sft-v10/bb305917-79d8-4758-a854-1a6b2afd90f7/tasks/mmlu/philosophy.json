            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "assistant\nTo answer your question, first let me explain the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Skeptical arguments often involve doubt or disbelief in some form. For instance, if someone doubts the existence of God, they might argue that there is no evidence for God's existence. However, this doubt does not justify the conclusion that God does not exist; rather, it merely casts doubt on the existence of God.\n2. Arbitrarily stringent standards often lead to skeptical arguments. For example, if someone claims that all religious beliefs are false, they might argue that there is no evidence for religious beliefs. However, this claim does not justify the conclusion that all religious beliefs are false; rather, it merely casts doubt on the existence of religious beliefs.\n3. Linguistic confusions often stem from inconsistent uses of language. For example, if someone refers to a book as \"the Bible,\" they might argue that the book is the only source of religious truth. However, this argument does not justify the conclusion that the Bible is the only source of religious truth; rather, it merely casts doubt on the existence of religious truth.\n4. Logically self-refuting arguments often stem from false assumptions. For example, if someone assumes that all religious beliefs are true, they might argue that there is no evidence for religious beliefs. However, this assumption does not justify the conclusion that all religious beliefs are true; rather, it merely casts doubt on the existence of religious beliefs.\n5. Ordinary standards often stem from inconsistent uses of language. For example, if someone refers to a book as \"the Bible,\" they might argue that the book is the only source of religious truth.

Immanuel Kant was a German philosopher who is considered one of the most important figures in modern philosophy. Kant believed that morality required humans to act on maxims that we could will to become universal laws. He argued that humans had a duty to act in such a way that maximized the greatest total happiness for everyone involved, and placed the interests of others above their own self-interest.
