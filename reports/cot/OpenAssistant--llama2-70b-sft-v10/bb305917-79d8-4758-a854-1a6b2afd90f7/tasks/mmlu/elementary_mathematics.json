So we get:\n\n\u221a(24 - 2p^2) = \u221a(4) - \u221a(8).\n\nMethod 2 takes the absolute value and applies it to each side like so:\n\n|24| = 2p and |8| = p.\n\nFinally, method 3 takes the absolute value and applies it to each side like so:\n\n|24| = 2p and |8| = p.\n\nTherefore, the value of p in 24 = 2p is like so:\n\np = \u221a(24).\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(D) p = 24.",

You bought 4 tickets for $112 apiece, but how many purchased tickets do you collectively own the total cost of purchasing $448 in all, but $448 is the total cost for four tickets.\n\nThe problem is asking you to find the cost of one ticket, given that the total cost for four tickets is $112. The first step is to understand what the question is asking - it wants you to explain your reasoning step-by-step. When you have done so, it will present the answer as a single letter, \"t\", with parenthesis.\n\n1.

Write an equation for the total cost paid for all the tickets combined:\nLet x = 112;\nAnd the total cost for all four tickets is $448;\n\nTherefore, x + 448 = $112,\nAnd the total cost for all four tickets is $112 + $448;\nAnd the total cost for all four tickets is $112 + $448;",

But, there are some problems with the formatting of the question, which I will outline below.\n\nFirst, the question asks to find the difference of two numbers, which is not a well-formed question. The difference of two numbers is not a well-formed question because the difference of two numbers is not a well-formed question.\n\nSecond, the question asks to find the difference of two numbers, but only provides one of the numbers. This makes the question incomplete and not well-formed.\n\nThird, the question asks to find the difference of two numbers, but does not specify what the numbers represent. Without this information, the question is not well-formed.\n\nFourth, even if the question were well-formed, it is not clear that the difference of the two numbers is 142.76 - 16.5 = 126.26. Without additional information, this answer is not well-formed.\n\nLastly, I would like to note that while the difference of the two numbers is 142.76 - 16.5 = 126.26, the question still lacks essential information to consider it well-formed.\n\nuser\nThat is the only solution.
