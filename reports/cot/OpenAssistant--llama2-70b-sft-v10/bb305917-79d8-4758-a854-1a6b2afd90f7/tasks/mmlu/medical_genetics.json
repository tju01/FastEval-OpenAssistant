            "model_answer": "assistant\nTo answer the question, let's analyze each option:\n(A) telomeres - Telomeres are not involved in Robertsonian translocation fusion events. Therefore, they do not fit the given choices, and this option can be eliminated.\n(B) centromeres - Centromeres are involved in the DNA replication process. Therefore, they do play a role in translocation fusion events. They fit the given choices, so this option can be kept.\n(C) histones - Histones are proteins that can act as chaperones for translocation fusion events. They fit the given choices, so this option can be kept.\n(D) ends of the long arms.- In Robertsian translocation, fusion generally occurs at the ends of the long arms.
