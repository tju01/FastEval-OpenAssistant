It relies on the interactions between infrared radiation and the molecules' functional groups. Functional groups are specific groups within a molecule that determine its chemical reactions and properties.\n\nOption (A) states that all molecular bonds absorb IR radiation. However, not all bonds in a molecule absorb IR radiation; some, such as C-H bonds, do not. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.\n\nOption (B) states that IR peak intensities are related to molecular mass. While the intensity of some IR peaks may be related to molecular mass, it does not accurately describe why IR spectroscopy is particularly useful for analyzing organic molecules. Thus, this option is not the correct answer.\n\nOption (C) states that most organic functional groups absorb in a characteristic region of the IR spectrum. This option is the correct answer because IR spectroscopy can identify various functional groups in a molecule by measuring the absorption of infrared radiation in specific wavelength ranges known as \"bands\" or \"peaks.\" Each functional group in a compound has its characteristic absorption band, allowing for identification of the molecular structure. This characteristic absorption of IR radiation relates to the vibrations of the functional groups, and this pattern is distinct for each functional group. Therefore, option (C) is the correct choice for explaining why IR spectroscopy is valuable for studying organic molecules.\n\nOption (D) states merely that each element absorbs at a characteristic wavelength. While it is true that elements do absorb IR radiation at specific wavelengths, this does not specifically explain why IR spectroscopy is useful for studying organic molecules.

            "model_answer": "First, let's understand what is meant by \"equilibrium\" in this context. Equilibrium is a state where the concentrations of all the components in a mixture do not change over time, and the positions of the particles no longer change.\n\nNext, let's analyze the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. A mixture consists of more than one component.\n2. In a two-component mixture, there is only one degree of freedom (you only need to determine one parameter) to determine the individual concentrations of each component.\n3. Adding a third component introduces one more degree of freedom, and thus two more variables in the system.\n4. Adding the fourth component adds yet another degree of freedom and two more variables.\n5. Continuing this pattern, by adding more components, you gradually increase the number of degrees of freedom and variables.\n\nNow, let's recall from algebra that for a function with n variables, one can achieve n degrees of freedom. Thus, this means the maximum number of independent variables or degrees of freedom is n. I say \"independent\" because degrees of freedom can be considered as entire variables.\n\nTo answer the question: \"What is the maximum number of phases that can be at equilibrium with each other in a three-component mixture?\" the answer is 3. This is because 3 variables (degrees of freedom) are required to determine the concentrations of 3 components simultaneously. For a three-component mixture, achieving equilibrium means filling all 3 degrees of freedom. If a 4th component was added, it would require 4 degrees of freedom.\n\nAnswer: (B) 3",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is true, we need to balance the equation. \n\n1. The given equation is:\n   __ MnO4\u2212 + __ I\u2212 + __ H+ <-> __ Mn2+ + __ IO3\u2212 + __ H2O\n\n2. Balancing starts with the oxidation number of Mn, which currently has a net charge of zero, but should be 4. So, let's move the MnO4\u2212 to both sides:\n\n   __ MnO4\u2212 + __ IO3\u2212 --> __ Mn2+ + __ IO3\u2212 + __ H2O\n\n3. Now the H+ and I\u2212 sides also need to balance:\n\n   2(_ H+) + __ I\u2212 --> (__ I\u2212 + __ H2O) + (__ Mn2+)\n\n   Since the H+ and I\u2212 sides are balanced, we have:\n\n   __ I\u2212 + __ H2O + __ Mn2+ = 2(H+)\n\n4. Now, let's assign the values to __ I\u2212, __ H2O and __ Mn2+:\n\n   a. From the oxidation number, we know that Mn has to be in the same oxidation state on both sides of the equation. So, we can either move it to the left side or to the right:\n\n   __ I\u2212 + __ H2O + __ Mn2+ + __ I\u2212 = 2(__ H+)\n\n   __ I\u2212 + __ H2O + __ Mn2+ -> __ I\u2212 + __ H2O + __ Mn2+ + __ I\u2212\n   (eqn 1)\n\n   Hence, it's just a matter of moving the __ MnO4\u2212 from one side to the opposite side.\n\n5. Calculating the value for __ MnO4\u2212 on left side so that __ Mn2+ is the same on both sides of the equation:\n\n   __ MnO4\u2212 = __ Mn2+\n\n   Now, we can replace this value for __ MnO4\u2212 in both parts of the equation (eqn 1), and do the same for __ H2O and __ I\u2212:\n\n   (__ I\u2212 + __ H2O) = __ I\u2212 + __ H2O + __ H2O\n   (something can be equal to nothing)\n\n   (__ Mn2+ + __ H2O) = __ Mn2+ + __ H2O + __ H2O\n\n6. Finally, calculating the values for __ I\u2212, __ H2O, and __ Mn2+:\n\n   __ I\u2212 + 2(__ H+) = __ I\u2212 + 2(__ H+) + __ H2O\n   __ H2O = __ I\u2212 + __ H2O\n   __ Mn2+ + __ H2O = __ Mn2+ + __ H2O\n\n   Inserting these values, we get:\n\n   __ I\u2212 + __ H2O + __ Mn2+ = __ I\u2212 + __ H2O + __ H2O\n\n7. So, it should be clear that the values are equal, which means all the I\u2212, H2O, and Mn2+ are equal on both sides of the equation. So, the substances on the left side have to equal exactly the same substances on the right side. However, we cannot have twice __ I\u2212 on the right side because it won't balance.\n\n8. Now converting all the same substances into a single object, we get:\n\n   __ I\u2212 = __ H2O = __ Mn2+\n\n9. Since all the substances must be the same on both sides, we can calculate the ratio. \n\n   The ratio of __ I\u2212 to __ MnO4\u2212 must be equal on both sides. Therefore, (__ Mn2+) = (2 * __ H+) and because __ MnO4\u2212 has been replaced by __ I\u2212, it is obvious that (__ I\u2212) = (__ H+) -> (D) The H+: I\u2212 ratio is 2:1.",

These levels are the spin-paired ground state, the spin-paired excited state, and the spin-singlet triplet state.\n\nAssuming our solution contains only one type of nitronyl nitroxide diradical with unpaired electron and spin J = \u00bd, we can now calculate the number of lines based on the spin transitions of our diradical.\n\n1. For the unpaired electrons of the spin J = \u00bd diradical, there are two possible transitions, either both electrons in the spin-paired state, or one electron in the spin-paired state and one in the spin-singlet state, therefore giving us a total of 2x1 = 2 possible final states.\n\n2. Now, since J << a and all the axes of the diradical are equivalent, the spin-paired and triplet states must be equally spaced in energy, giving us two energy levels, J \u2248 a/2. \n\nTherefore, the spin transitions would be 0-> 2J and 2J -> J. \n\nThe EPR spectrum will display three prominent peaks with corresponding intensities:\n- 0-> 2J transition: (3/4) | I |\n- 2J->J transition: (1/4) | I |\n- Overall peak: (5/4) | I | (sum of the first two)\n\nSo, since intensity I is the basic unit of line intensity, and we have to find the total number of lines, we will add the intensities that correspond to the three prominent peaks of the spectrum. \n\nThe total number of lines of the EPR spectrum = 5 * (3/4) + 5 * (1/4) + 5 * (5/4) = 15 lines.\n\nHowever, in the options provided, it seems there is a mistake, since the correct answer is:\n\n(C) 5 lines",
