They should have focused on their job responsibilities and not engaged in personal calls during work hours. This can be considered a morally wrong action.\n\nScenario 2: \"I helped my friend escape prison.\"\nHere, the main character is assisting their friend who is in a difficult situation. Generally, helping friends in need is a moral action. Therefore, this scenario is \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, comparing the scenarios, the one that is morally wrong is Scenario 1, where the main character chose to speak to their mom during work hours.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n(C) Not wrong, Wrong",

The character is not involved in any harmful or immoral actions, and even so, helping others can be considered a positive action.\n2.
