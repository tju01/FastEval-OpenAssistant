            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to know the main factors preventing subsistence economies from advancing economically.\n\nStep 1: Identify the factors that could prevent subsistence economies from advancing.\nFactors that could prevent subsistence economies from advancing include lack of access to information, technology, capital, and support from markets.\n\nStep 2: Compare the options provided.\nWe cannot select option A, as a currency is not a factor that directly affects subsistence economy growth. Option C is not entirely relevant to subsistence economies, but it does not prevent their advancement either.\n\nStep 3: Determine the most important factor.\nA well-connected transportation infrastructure (B) and a banking service (D) play a major role in supporting subsistence economies as they enable local communities to engage in trade and exchange goods and services. However, without a currency to facilitate these transactions, these factors become less significant.\n\nConclusion:\nThe answer to this question is (B) a well-connected transportation infrastructure. So the most important factor preventing subsistence economies from advancing economically is the lack of a currency.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we must first understand the key concepts described in each option.\n\nOption A: Zero population growth refers to a situation where the birth and death rates in a population are equal, leading to a stable population size.\n\nOption B: Rapid growth rate refers to a situation where the population size is increasing quickly with a surplus of birth rates compared to the death rate.\n\nOption C: Homeostatic plateau is a situation where the rate of growth of a population becomes very slow but is still higher than the death rate, keeping the population at a constant size.\n\nOption D: Demographic momentum refers to a situation in which a population continues to grow even after reaching replacement fertility levels due to the large number of individuals still in the productive age range.\n\nNow, we will determine which of these terms best fits the question's description: the tendency for a population to continue to grow long after replacement fertility has been achieved.\n\nBased on the explanations above:\n\nOption A: Zero population growth refers to a stable population size and refers to a stable fertility rate. This is not the correct term for the question.\n\nOption B: Rapid growth rate refers to an increase in population, not continuing growth after replacement fertility is reached. This is not the correct term for the question.\n\nOption C: Homeostatic plateau refers to a slow-growing population and is not related to continuing growth after replacement fertility is reached. This is not the correct term for the question.\n\nOption D: Demographic momentum refers to continuing population growth even after replacement fertility levels are reached, and matches the description provided in the question.\n\nSo, after analyzing the options, the correct term for the tendency for a population to continue to grow long after replacement fertility has been achieved is:\n\n(D) demographic momentum.",

            "question": "The tendency for migration to decrease with distance is called\n\n(A) push factors.\n(B) pull factors.\n(C) distance decay.\n(D) migration selectivity.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let us break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. The goal of this question is not only to provide the correct answer, but also to explain the reason behind it.\n\n2. The question asks about the tendency for migration to decrease with distance. There are some migration factors that cause people to leave a place (pull factors) and some factors that force people to move away from that place (push factors). \n\n3. Based on our understanding of migration theories, the phenomenon we are looking for must be a factor that pushes people away from their original location, as the question references migration tending to decrease with distance.\n\n4. Given this context, let's look at the options (A) push factors, (B) pull factors, (C) distance decay, and (D) migration selectivity.\n\nA) Push factors: these are factors that make people leave a location, contrary to the question's requirements, since it mentions that the migration tendency decreases with distance.\n\nB) Pull factors: this category generally refers to the positive attractions that draw people to a new place, which doesn't resolve the issue implied in the question (decreasing tendency of migration with distance).\n\nC) Distance decay: this term is related to spatial interactions, and we are looking for an explanation for decreasing migration tendency based on distance. It might appear plausible but shouldn't be the answer.\n\nD) Migration selectivity: this term is not related to explaining the migration tendency as a function of distance.\n\n5. From the analysis of the options, It can be deduced that, the answer to this question must be related to the place people are moving away from (as we are seeking an explanation of why migration decreases with distance), hence, the answer must involve \"push factors\" to \"push\" people away - the \"opposite\" or \"negative\" force relative to pull factors.\n\n6. As a result, the answer is (A) push factors since it explains the phenomenon of migration decreasing with distance - people move away from a place (or leave their country) as they move further away from it. The stronger the negative factors at their location, the more likely they are to emigrate farther from their homeland. The further away they get, the weaker these negative factors (push factors) become. This causes the migration tendency to decrease over distance.\n\nSo, the final single-letter answer, therefore, is representative of the concept that \"pushes\" people away from their original location, and is (A) push factors.",

The share of women in the total labor force has been increasing.\n\n(D) Women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia - This statement is false. According to recent data, the average number of weekly hours worked by women worldwide is 40-50 hours, whereas for men it's 44-48 hours.\n\nAfter analyzing each statement, we can conclude that the answer is (C) The percentage of women in the total labor force declined.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The form of migration farm workers from another country are most likely practicing during the year is:\n\n(C) Circular migration\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. Chain migration refers to the process whereby successive people from the same place or same ethnic or religious community move to an area. Farm workers from another country may not necessarily follow this pattern.\n2. Cluster migration refers to the migration of a group of people from one specific geographic unit to another specific geographic unit within the same country. This doesn't apply to farm workers from another country.\n3. Circular migration refers to a pattern of repeated migration where a person moves regularly between two or more locations, spending varying lengths of time in each location, and returning to the original departure location eventually, or intentionally moving in a cyclical pattern. This option is more likely for farm workers from another country, as they often move to agricultural areas for work, then return to their origin when the work is done.\n4. International migration is when a person permanently leaves their country of origin and moves to another country. This usually isn't applicable to farm workers, as they typically return to their original departure locations eventually.\n\nTherefore, based on the patterns and nature of agricultural work, the correct answer is (C) Circular migration.",
