            "model_answer": "To determine the answer, we should go through the explanation step by step:\n\n1. The Barkhausen criterion is a method used to analyze oscillator stability in systems with a feedback loop.\n2. The question provides us with four options: A, B, C, and D.\n3. Option (A) states that the loop gain should be unity. This is a condition for oscillation, as it ensures that the sensitivity of the system is neither too high nor too low.\n4. Option (B) states that the loop gain should be less than unity. This condition could lead to instability if the gain becomes extremely small.\n5. Option (C) states that the phase of a feedback signal with respect to input should be 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0. For a phase difference of 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0, the oscillation frequency would be the same as the input frequency, which is essential for oscillatory behavior.\n6. Option (D) states that both (A) and (C) apply. This condition ensures that the gain is neither too low nor too high, leading to stable oscillation with a high signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nConsidering the above explanation, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Both (A) and (C)",

            "model_answer": "Let us evaluate the choices (A, B, C, and D) for the given statement: \"Potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement is more accurate than direct measurement using a voltmeter because\".\n\nStep 1: Understand the potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement:\nA potentiometer measures an output voltage, which is the voltage that remains after a circuit resistance is subtracted. This measurement uses a sensitive element (e.g., a meter) connected to a resistive element (e.g., a potentiometer) to detect a difference in the input voltage.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each option:\n(A) It loads the circuit moderately: Maybe yes, as it introduces a little resistance to the shunt part of the circuit, but not a significant load. The accurate measurement comes from the ability to read small voltage changes, not the load in the circuit.\n\n(B) It loads the circuit to maximum extent: Incorrect. The potentiometer only serves to measure a potential difference across its terminals. It does not load the entire circuit.\n\n(C) It uses a center zero galvanometer instead of a voltmeter: Incorrect. A potentiometer does not use a center zero galvanometer. It uses a sensitive device to measure the potential difference across an inductor coil and a resistor.\n\n(D) It does not load the circuit at all: Incorrect. A potentiometer introduces some resistance, albeit a minimal one, into the measured resistance. The accurate measurements result from sensitivity to small voltage differences rather than lack of resistance in the circuit.\n\nBECAUSE of the above analysis, the most fitting answer is:\n(A) It loads the circuit moderately. The accurate measurements in the potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement come from its sensitivity to small voltages instead of loading effect, which rarely affects the measurements.",

            "model_answer": "To find the range of firing angle control for a single-phase one-pulse controlled circuit, we need to first find the net voltage across the load at any position, R_T. Then, multiply it by the load's resistance R to find the maximum quantum that can be delivered by the circuit.\n\n1. Net voltage across the load (R_T) = time-varying voltage - counter emf\n2. Replace resistance and voltage values in the equation to find R_T\n3. R_T = (400)sin(314 t) - (200)\n\nNow we need to find the minimum and maximum possible R_T values for the firing angle range (30\u00b0 to 150\u00b0), and then check which of these values corresponds to t = 0 (the firing angle).\n\n4. Calculate minimum R_T value: 400 * sin(314 * 180/360) - 200 = 0 - 200 = -200\n5. Calculate maximum R_T value: 400 * sin(150 / 360 * 314) - 200 = 400 * 0.6269 - 200 = -400\n6. Since there's no solution for t = 0 (R_T = 0), let's find the closest value to 180\u00b0 (which is the same as t = 0 in degrees)\n7. R_T = -200V at 30\u00b0 angle (R_T calculated above)\n8. 180\u00b0 is less than 30\u00b0, so the nearest angle is 30\u00b0.\n\nNow we can find how much energy can be delivered by the circuit for the firing angle of 30\u00b0:\n\n9. -200V * 30 = -6000J (note: Joules, not watts)\n\nSo, for a load counter emf of 200 V, the range of firing angle control for a single-phase one-pulse controlled circuit with a 400 V sin(314 t) source voltage is:\n\n(B) 30\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the electric field in the gap between the two charged infinite metal plates, we need to analyze the phenomenon based on Coulomb's Law and superposition principle in electrostatics. First, let's look at this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two infinite metal plates separated by a gap. The plates are charged with an electric field and same polarity (positive or negative).\n2. The Coulomb's Law states that the electric field between any two points in a uniform electric field is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between these points.\n3. Superposition principle states that the total electric field produced in a point due to multiple charges can be found by simply adding the electric fields that each individual charge produces at that point.\n4. As the two plates have the same polarity, the electric field lines will point in the same direction between them.\n5. According to the superposition principle, we can sum the electric fields produced by each of the charges on the plates to find the total electric field at any point between the plates.\n\nNow, let's calculate. If the two plates each have charge density \u03c3 and are separated by distance d, then according to Coulomb's Law, the electric field produced is:\n\nE = F / q = (3\u03c3 / 4\u03c0epsilon_0 r^2) / (q) = (3\u03c3 / 4\u03c0epsilon_0 d^2),\n\nwhere q is the test charge we are considering. We have to find the electric field at any point (x, y) between the two plates, denoted as E(x, y).\n\n6. Since the total electric field is given by the stage equation of superposition principle:\n\nE=k\u03a3i\u00b3\u03c3i/r\u00b3\n\nwhere E is the total electric field, \u03a3i is the total charge, \u03c3i is the net charge density on the ith plate, and r is the distance between the point (x, y) and the plate i. In our case, \u03a3i=2\u03c3 and r^2=d^2.\n\n7. Now, plug in the values into the equation:\n\nE = (3\u03c3 / 4\u03c0epsilon_0 d^2) \u03a3i\u00b3\u03a3i^(-2)r^(-2), \n\nwhere \u03a3i^(-2) equals to 1/2\u03a3i.\n\n8. Simplify and solve for E:\n\nE = (3\u03c3 / 4\u03c0epsilon_0 d^2) (1/2^2) (\u03a3i^2)(1/r^2)  = (3 / 4\u03c0epsilon_0)(1/4)(Sum{\u03c3)^2}) (1/d^2) = (3 / 4\u03c0epsilon_0) x (Sum{\u03c3)^2}) / d^2\n\n10. Now divide Sum{\u03a3si)^2} by d^2:\n\nSum{\u03c3)^2} / d^2 = 2\u03c3/d^2 = (3/4)Sigma {\u03c3) / d^2)\n\n11. Combining all terms, we get:\n\nE = (3 / 4\u03c0epsilon_0) x (2/(4/d^2)) \u2261 E_{divergent})\n\n12. As the plates have the same polarity, since E_{divergent} always produces divergent result, it means that the total electric field produced by two infinite metal plates with the same polarity is zero. Then, the final answer is:\n\n(D) zero.",
