Find the number of real solutions of the equation in the interval [0, 1]. Notice that the interval is from 0 to 1.\n2. Since the equation defines a real-valued function, we just need to find all the real x-values, where the equation holds true.\n3. We can observe that there is only one x-value less than 1, which makes e^x > x. That is x = 0.\n4. Therefore, the number of real solutions of the equation in the interval [0, 1] is 1 (since there's only one x value that makes the equation equal 0: x = 0). So, k = 1.\n5. Now, since x=0 is the only real solution of the equation in the interval [0, 1], all other real solutions must be outside the interval [0,1].\n6. Notice that the interval [0, 1] has 2 distinct sides, left side = [0, 1) and right side = (1, 2).\n7. Therefore, the number of real solutions that are not in [0, 1] is 2, since there is only 1 real solution found in [0, 1] (step 5).\n8.

We are looking for additive abelian groups G that have the property that if I add any element \"x\" four times, it will result in 0. This is asking for the behaviour of the zero element in a group, which is different from the identity element, so we can call it the empty element in our case.\n\nAn abelian group is a group where the composition of two elements is commutative; it does not matter which element you multiply with which. You might familiar with this term since operations on numbers are abelian (commutative). So, we are looking for such a group with 16 elements where the empty element is zero.\n\nNow let's start-\n\nIsabella, who is no good at mathematics will give you a hint : In such a group, the empty element must be a member of the group, which means (-empty + empty) = empty.\n\nNow let's think, Peter. Every element must be of type \"x + 0\", effectively, \"0 in G\". The problem asks if these elements would ever add up to an empty group element. For 16 empty group elements (perhaps a children's bus group) those would be -16 empty groups, which would make sure all combinations add together to empty later. And yet, empty groups added together would still be empty at the end.\n\nSo, Diogenes could say \"... for each group N, N must exist\". So, our answer could be (A) 0, (B) 1, (C) 2 or (D) 3, depending upon what peculiar cards are dealt to us. Because there can be 0 such groups, 1 such group, 2 such groups or 3 such groups respectively. \n\nBut, in the quick, it would be easier to just answer that the hidden variable does not get the groups, so our answer is (A) 0.",

We'll represent polynomials as\n\np(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 +... + a_dx^d\n\nwhere a_0 = p(0), a_1 = p'(0), a_2 = p''(0), and so on.\n\nNull space of D (n) consists of polynomials that have the same derivative as the zero polynomial, i.e., those that have a_0, a_1,..., a_d = 0 for all d from 0 to 7.\n\nRange of D (r) consists of polynomials that are not in the null space of D and have non-zero derivatives.\n\nThe zero polynomial is just f(x) = 0, and the derivative of any polynomial is zero if and only if the polynomial is the zero polynomial. (This follows from the definition of a derivative.)\n\nThe dimension of the null space is also the number of polynomials in P that have derivative equal to zero. Note that the derivatives of polynomials are not unique; for example, for any p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 +... + a_dx^d, we can have its derivative as p\u2032(x) = -a_1x + 2a_2x^2 - 3a_3x^3 +..., which is different from p\u2032(x) = -a_0 - a_1x + 2a_2x^2 - 3a_3x^3 +..., but both give the same result for p\u2032(x) = 0.\n\nSo there are two polynomials (p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 +...)in P whose derivative is equal to 0:\np(x) = 0 (the zero polynomial) and\np(x) = 0xs (-1x + 2x^2 - 3x^3 +... with a_0 = a_1 = 0).\n\nSo the size of the null space n = 2.\n\nNow, we need to find the size of the range r. All polynomials in the range r have non-zero derivatives, so there are 6 polynomials with non-zero derivatives in the range r, as we accounted one polynomial having zero derivative, which is m(x) = 0:\nr = {p(x)!= 0s | p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 +... + a_dx^d}\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the null space n and range r of D are two respectively.\n\nAnd so, the answer is:\n\n(D) n = 2 and r = 6",

Start at point A (0, 0) and move the first small segment by some distance 'a' (with negative possibility as we note below) such that the smaller segment lies on the positive x-axis (or outside the origin if necessary). Therefore, it is at coordinates (0, a).\n2. Now, starting from point A, let's go to point B (10, 0) and move the second smaller segment by some distance 'b' such that it lies on the positive x-axis (again, with negative possibility if it's outside the x-axis). Therefore, it is at coordinates (10, b).\n\n3. This leaves only one smaller segment left, and we must place it such that all three of the smaller segments form the three sides of a triangle.\n\nTo do this, let's use the concept of a triangle. Given a triangle with vertices A, B, and C, the formula for its area is: Area = 1/2 x (Side 1 x Side 2) = 1/2 x ((A - B) x (C - A))\n\nLet's say the value a moves the first small segment such that it lies on a line (A building block) because there can\u2019t be multiple triangles. Then it lies on a line. Let\u2019s say the value b moves the third small segment such that it lies on the line. So distance a and b will become length of triangle side. The length of triangle is a+b.\nBut, All length of triangle's sides should be greater than 0 otherwise the triangle will not form. That's why we can't take a and b negative, since the 2 smaller segments won't form the bottom corners of the triangle. \n\nSo a and b will only be positive. \n(Note - a and b can't both be 0 because again then the triangle won't form)\nSince, a and b can only be positive, when a plus b is largest, the triangle will have its largest possible sidelength and the probability of such a triangle is highest.\n\nSo, we can choose a = 5 units, b = 5 units.\nCalculating their sum gives us a + b = 10.\nIn this case since a + b = segment length, length of one side of triangle will be 10 and area will be 1/2 x (10 x 10) = 100.\n\nAs area is given as 100, we can calculate length of one side of triangle = Area / (1/2 x Length)\nLength of one side of triangle = 100/2 = 50 units.\nSo a+b is 100.\nNow to find probability, give a probability factor of one which means each side has probability of forming of one in 10 triangles.\nResultant probability = (100 / (2 x 2 x 2)) * 1.\nResultant probability = 100 / 12 = 5/3\n\nSo there's a 50% chance that the three smaller segments form the sides of a triangle. \nSo the probability is 50.\nSo the correct answer would be (D) 50%.",
