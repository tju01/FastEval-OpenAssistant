            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand the context and the relevant laws regulating maritime crimes.\n\nThe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, which is responsible for settling disputes relating to international maritime law, does not have jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels.\n\n(A) The coastal State typically has jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels within its territorial waters or a contravention of any law or regulation relating to the protection and preservation of the marine environment.\n\n(B) The flag State exercises jurisdiction on matters concerning the vessel and its master, however, its jurisdiction extends only within the territory of that State and not on board vessels out at sea.\n\nThere are two States that ordinarily exercise jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels:\n\n(C) All States of the same nationality as the victim have collective responsibility to prosecute crimes committed on board their vessels.\n\n(D) The flag State exercises jurisdiction over crimes committed on their vessel anywhere in the world, regardless of where the crime was committed.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) The flag State",

            "model_answer": "(A) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders. \n\nExplanation:\nJusticiability is a concept in law which deals with the power of the courts to hear and settle disputes. In this context, it refers to the assessment of whether a particular right can be enforced, meaning whether it can be legally acted upon or whether there is an effective procedure allowing the relevant rights holders to seek justice for their rights being violated.",

            "question": "In what way is Responsibility to Protect (R2P) different from humanitarian intervention?\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Let's break down the difference between Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and humanitarian intervention step by step:\n\n1. Context: R2P is a concept from the United Nations (UN), whereas humanitarian intervention implies a state's action to help people in need when their government is unable to do so or is responsible for the harm.\n  \n2. Authorization: Unlike humanitarian intervention, R2P requires a broader international authorization, specifically from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). R2P typically aims to avert a potential humanitarian crisis rather than responding to an ongoing one.\n\n3. Principled basis: R2P calls for a comprehensive approach to protecting civilians from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity, including preventive measures and the use of force. In contrast, humanitarian intervention typically focuses on providing assistance to civilians affected by conflict.\n\n4. Forceful measures: While both R2P and humanitarian intervention may involve military force in some cases, R2P requires explicit approval from the UNSC before using force. Humanitarian intervention may not always involve this level of authorization, especially when conducted by individual states without coordinating with international organizations.\n\nConsidering these factors, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "A) The so-called Lotus principle is that'restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed', or, as it has been construed, 'whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law'.\n\nThe Lotus principle (A) states that there are no restrictions placed on the actions of States, unless they have explicitly banned them within customary international law or treaties. This principle asserts that in the absence of prohibitions, States are free to act however they choose within their mandated spheres. This principle is often used in arguments about freedom of State sovereignty and navigating issues within the realm of international relations and trade. \n\nB is not the Lotus principle, it incorrectly defines it as defining which court a state might submit a dispute to, which is not what the Lotus principle is about.\n\nC is incorrect because it claims that States are not prohibited to enforce their jurisdiction on the high seas. This contradicts the idea of international law which indeed does place some restrictions on the acts of States in relation to the high seas. \n\nD is also incorrect, this principle preserves the exclusive jurisdiction to each State or region when present on international waters. It doesn't negate restrictions, quite the contrary.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer appears in letter A, The so-called Lotus principle is that States are free to act unless explicitly prohibited by customary international law or treaties they participate in, a principle used in the field of international relations and trade.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "We have to choose which of these statements best describes the UK Constitution. Let's go through them step by step:\n\n(A) The UK Constitution's only source of power is that of the sovereign - This statement is almost true. The sovereign (the monarch) in the UK does have power, but it's not the only source. In the UK, there's Parliament, and they have more direct power to make decisions. So, this statement isn't describing the whole constitution.\n\n(B) The UK Constitution gives the judiciary the power to overturn acts of parliament - In the UK, the judiciary has a limited role in overturning acts of parliament, giving the courts the power to review if a law conflicts with the UK's written bill of rights (called the Human Rights Act). So in some situations, the courts can overturn laws, but it's not a central part of how the UK Parliament functions.\n\n(C) The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources - This statement is true. The UK does not have a single constitution, like the U.S. has. The constitution, or rather \"the constitutions,\" are written down in multiple sources, including examples like the Magna Carta, Acts of Parliament, and court decisions. These are interconnected to form the UK's constitution.\n\n(D) The UK Constitution is based on a Bill of Rights - Another true statement. The right to life, freedom of speech, and other values are protected by the Bill of Rights in the Human Rights Act, and these rights are important parts of the UK Constitution. So this statement goes well with point (C) above.\n\nFrom our analysis, the statement that best describes the UK Constitution is:\n\n(C) The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources.\n\n(D) is closely related but doesn't fully capture the nature of the UK Constitution. Both (C) and (D) together would be even more accurate, but we're asked to choose the one that best describes the UK Constitution, and since (C) identifies the significant and unique aspect of the UK Constitution, I'll go with (C).",

            "model_answer": "Let's analyze each statement separately:\n\n(A) This statement is false because Protocol 14 did not introduce any changes regarding the formation of the committee assessing admissibility cases. It merely aimed to strengthen the protection of minorities and some other rulings from the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\n(B) This statement is false because Protocol 14 added a new dimension (Article 15 bis) to the admissibility criterion, emphasizing non-appeal of domestic remedies when there's a substantial risk of irreparable harm. However, it didn't change or abolish all existing criteria.\n\n(C) This statement is false because Protocol 14 did not abolish the Commission of Human Rights but, in fact, addressed issues related to the collective control of the implementation of the Convention, like a necessary figure to the Court's task.\n\n(D) This statement is false because Protocol 14 did not extend the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights.
