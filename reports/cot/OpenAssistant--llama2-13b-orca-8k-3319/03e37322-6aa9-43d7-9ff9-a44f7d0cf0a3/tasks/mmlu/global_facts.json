            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this step-by-step, let's first determine the percentage of the population that is overweight. Since the question is about adults aged 18 years or older as of 2016, we'll use the BMI (Body Mass Index) as the standard measure of overweight/obesity.\n\nBMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared. To determine if BMI is overweight, the range of considered ideal BMIs will be from 18.5 to 24.9 and overweight ranges from 25.0 to 29.9.\n\nIn 2016, the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) reported the following:\n\n- 1.4 million U.S. adults had a BMI of 30.0 to 34.9 (obese)\n- 3.5 million U.S. adults had a BMI of 35.0 or over (extreme obesity)\n\nLet's find out the percentage of overweight adults by finding the sum of overweight and obese adults' percentages:\n\n- 25.0% to 29.9 earns the title of overweight\n- 30.0% to 34.9 earns the title of obese\n- 35.0% and over earns the title of extreme obesity\n\nNow, let's do the math:\n\n1) Multiply each percentage by the group size:\n1.4*%.4, 3.5*%.5 = 0.6, 1.8 =.0576%\n2) Add and find the sum:\n.0576% +.0576% =.1152%\n3) To come up with the percentage for overweight adults, divide the sum by two (there are two groups):\n.1152% /2 =.0576%\n\nAs per the reasoning, about 5.76% of adults aged 18 years or older were overweight. Out of the provided options, there is no matching percentage in the given list. However, the answer is approximately 5.76%.",

            "model_answer": "In order to find the GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 when adjusting for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices, we need to perform a series of calculations.\n\nStep 1: Convert 1850 US dollar to 2011 dollar equivalent:\nWe need to find the inflation rate from 1850 to 2011. We can get the CPI (Consumer Price Index) by year, which allows us to calculate the value of a dollar over time. Let's use Dun and Bradstreet's data to deduce prices from 1850-2011 (it's assumed that there are no drastic changes in the inflation rate during the intervening years).\n\nThe table displays the estimated median family income and consumer price index levels for all the years:\n\n1850: $300 (Inflation-adjusted Prices: MF) 1850\n1860: $400 (Inflation-adjusted Prices: MF) 1860\n1870: $500 (Inflation-adjusted Prices: MF) 1870\n\nLet's assume that between these years, the inflation rate was relatively steady and constant. In this case, we can take the ratio of 500:400 = 1.25.\n\n2011 CPI/ 1850 CPI = 1,184.592/1 = 1,185 (assumption)\n\nTo find the present value of $300 in 1850 (unadjusted for inflation, but still adjusted for CPI), you can multiply the 1,185 by 300: \n\n$300 * 1,185 = $355,500\n\nStep 2: Calculate Multiplier Effect:\nTo adjust for differences in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), we need to apply a multiplier effect. We can use the World Bank's estimated GDP of $15.73 trillion in 2011 (US dollars), assuming a PPP exchange rate (PROW) of 0.8 and updating to constant 2010 US dollars.\n\nUsing the PPP conversion factor of 0.8:\n$15.73 * 0.8 = $12.594 trillion (Adjusted GDP for PPP)\n\nStep 3: Convert the adjusted GDP in PPP terms into 2011 nominal US dollars:\nTo find the US dollar equivalent in 2011 dollars, we will multiply by the 2011-adjusted CPI (from step 1). The adjusted constant 2010 US dollars are therefore:\n\n$12.594 trillion * 1,185 (constant 2011 CPI value from step 1) = $14.98 trillion adjusted GDP (2011 prices)\n\nStep 4: Calculate GDP Per Capita:\nFinally, divide this by the population of the United States (around 300 million). Let's calculate it in 2011 US dollars per capita according to PPP and constant 2010 inflation-adjusted prices.\n\n$14.98 trillion \u00f7 300 million = $49.88k\n\nTherefore, the GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 adjusted for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices would be approximately $49.88 thousand (D).",

Since it covers a wide range of issues, we need to focus on the section specifically asking about homosexuality.\n\nStep 2: Interpreting the data\nThe GSS extracts multiple data points related to homosexuality, specifically about specific practices and likelihood of acceptance.

            "model_answer": "To determine the increase in GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016 in Japan, we first need to find the growth rate for the given time period. We will calculate the percentage increase using the data for 1950 and 2016, and then we can use the formula for exponential growth to obtain the multiplier. \n\nStep 1: Obtain GDP data for 1950 and 2016\nStep 2: Calculate the percentage increase\nStep 3: Use the formula for exponential growth\nStep 4: Provide the total number of times the base GDP has increased\n\nGDP per capita in 1950: $15,713\nGDP per capita in 2016: $44,647\n\nStep 2: Calculate the percentage increase\nPercentage increase = ((GDP per capita 2016 / GDP per capita 1950) - 1) * 100\nPercentage increase = ((44,647 / 15,713) - 1) * 100\nPercentage increase \u2248 207.65\n\nStep 3: Use the formula for exponential growth\nUsing the formula for exponential growth, Y = Y0 * (1 + r)t, where Y0 is the base GDP per capita in 1950, r is the exponential growth rate (which is the same as its percentage), and t is the time period.\n\nWe know the base GDP per capita (Y0), the percentage increase (r), and the time period (t). So we can calculate:\n\nY = 15,713 * (1 + r) * 66.67\nY \u2248 15,713 * (1 + 207.65) * 66.67\nY \u2248 15,713 * (1.20765) * 66.67\nY \u2248 19,181 * 66.67\nY \u2248 1,276,737\n\nSo the exponential growth of the GDP in Japan from 1950 to 2016 would have been approximately 1,276,737. However, this number is not directly visible as a percentage of the GDP per capita in 1950, so we will use the percentual increase of the total population to convert it into units of population increase.\n\nJapan population in 1950: 83,485,403\nJapan population in 2016: 125,337,448\n\nStep 4: Provide the total number of times the base GDP has increased\nFinally, we divide the total increase in GDP (1,276,737) by the base year's population (83,485,403), which indicates that the GDP per capita increased by approximately 1,526% over the 66.67-year period. This is approximately 15-fold. So the answer is:\n\n(C) by 15 fold",

The cause of death varies greatly depending on country and region, but lower respiratory infections are still a significant cause of child mortality.\n(B) Preterm birth complications - According to the World Health Organization, preterm babies account for about 15% of all child deaths globally. However, preterm birth complications don't come at the top of the list.\n(C) Diarrheal diseases - Diarrheal diseases are one of the leading causes of death in children, especially in developing countries. According to the World Health Organization, about 525,000 children under five years old died from diarrhea in 2017.\n(D) Malaria - Although malaria is still a major cause of illness and death, particularly in Africa, deaths from malaria have been decreasing in recent years due to better control measures and prevention. It's not necessarily the leading cause.\n\nTo determine the biggest cause of death in children under five years old as of 2017, let's compare the percentages:\n\n- Lower respiratory infections (A) - 15%\n- Preterm birth complications (B) - 15%\n- Diarrheal diseases (C) - 10% (approximate)\n- Malaria (D) - not the largest, but let's assume it's following closely to Choice C\n\nNow, let's look at which of these choices has the highest percentage of deaths:\n\n- Preterm birth complications (B) - 15%\n- Diarrheal diseases (C) - 10% (assumed)\n\nSince both Choice B (Preterm birth complications) and Choice C (Diarrheal diseases) have approximately the same percentage of deaths, we can't definitively say which one is the biggest cause.
