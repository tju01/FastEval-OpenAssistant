            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand the concepts and their relationship:\n\nMarginal Revenue (MR): It is the additional revenue that a firm earns from producing and selling one more unit of output.\nMarginal Cost (MC): It is the additional cost incurred by a firm when producing and selling one more unit of output.\nTotal Revenue (TR): It is the total revenue generated from selling all the units of output produced.\nTotal Cost (TC): It is the total cost incurred in producing all the units of output.\n\nNow, let's examine each option and determine which one matches the conditions for marginal revenue and marginal cost to be equal:\n\n(A) total revenue is greater than total cost at its greatest distance\nAt the extremes, total revenue may be greater than total cost, but marginal revenue and marginal cost will always eventually diverge or decrease. So, this statement is not correct.\n\n(B) total revenue is equal to total cost\nWhen total revenue is equal to total cost, the marginal revenue would also be equal to marginal cost. We can see this intuitive as in such a situation, the additional revenue from producing one more unit would completely offset the additional cost of producing that same unit. \n\n(C) Marginal product is at its highest point\nMarginal product is not directly related to the point at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Therefore, this statement is not correct.\n\n(D) total product is at its highest point\nTotal product is the measure of output available when all factors of production are at their maximum productivity, expressed as product per unit of the variable inputs. Total product is directly related to the total output (quantity \u00d7 price) rather than the individual units sold.\n\nConclusion: From our reasoning, the answer is (B) total revenue equals total cost. This is because total revenue is at maximum when total cost is at its minimum, incurring a minimal net loss or profit (total revenue less total cost). This maximizes resource utilization while minimizing waste and inefficiency.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the best option for the firm, we need to look at the productivity and the cost of production for both labor and capital.\n\nStep 1: Recall the given information \n- Labor price: $2\n- Capital price: $1\n- Marginal product of labor: 200\n- Marginal product of capital: 50\n\nStep 2: Analyze option (A)\n- Decrease labor and increase capital\n\nThis option would increase the capital, but it does not directly affect the marginal product of capital or labor. So, it is not sufficient to find the best course of action.\n\nStep 3: Analyze option (B)\n- Increase capital and decrease labor\n\nIncreasing capital would lead to an increase in capital productivity. However, since the marginal product of capital is already the highest it can be (50), increasing capital is unlikely to give a higher marginal product. Similarly, decreasing labor lowers labor productivity. In light of this, this option does not seem to be the best option.\n\nStep 4: Analyze option (C)\n- Decrease capital and increase labor\n\nDecreasing capital lowers productivity. This would be better than option (B) since we are already at the maximum possible marginal product of capital (50). Increasing labor would directly increase labor productivity.\n\nSince the marginal product of labor (200) is considerably higher than the marginal product of capital (50), the firm would benefit from a larger share of overall output being contributed by labor. So, the best option for the firm is:\n\n(D) Decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of capital falls and the marginal product of labor rises.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's go through the options one by one and understand their meaning with respect to a Nash equilibrium.\n\nOption A: At a Nash equilibrium, the supply curve intersects the demand curve.\nA Nash equilibrium occurs when no party has any incentive to change their behavior due to strategic reasons. An intersection between the demand curve and the supply curve refers to a part where they line up horizontally. This option does not directly correlate with the Nash equilibrium conditions, so it is not the right answer.\n\nOption B: At a Nash equilibrium, neither party has an incentive to deviate from his or her strategy.\nThis definition directly points towards the concept of Nash equilibrium, since it conveys that no player has any motivation to change their strategy. Furthermore, it opposes with deviation from their strategy that would result in better outcomes. This option is likely a valid definition of a Nash equilibrium.\n\nOption C: At a Nash equilibrium, the marginal revenue curve intersects the marginal cost curve.\nThis option is unrelated to the concept of a Nash equilibrium. MARGINAL REVENUE CURVE combines the price and the profits or losses for goods a company newly produces (but not for other goods) when its production increases a bit more. Likewise, MARGINAL COST is the change in cost for the firm for producing one more unit, given all its inputs and fixed costs are variable. However, it's not a condition involving supply, demand, or strategic behavior that defines a Nash equilibrium.\n\nOption D: At a Nash equilibrium, the equilibrium is unstable and each party would like to switch strategies.\nAs the equilibrium is unstable, the likelihood of players switching strategies will be high. Therefore, it contradicts the definition of Nash equilibrium.\n\nBased on the provided options, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) At a Nash equilibrium, neither party has an incentive to deviate from his or her strategy.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the concept of cross-price elasticity\nIf the cross-price elasticity between goods X and Y is +2.0, it means that for a 1% increase in the price of good Y, the demand for good X increases by 2% (which is a positive elasticity).\n\nStep 2: Connect cross-price elasticity to the types of goods (normal, inferior, substitute, complementary)\n- If the cross-price elasticity is positive, it means that the two goods are related (elasticity is generally positive if they are either substitutes, complements, or both).\n- If the goods are substitutes, the cross-price elasticity will be positive. If they are complements, it will be negative, and if they are unrelated, it will be 0.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the possible options\nNow, let's go through the options one by one:\n\n(A) Goods X and Y are normal goods.\n- If goods X and Y are all normal goods, then they would have a cross-price elasticity of 0 between each other, and thus this choice is unlikely.\n\n(B) Goods X and Y are inferior goods.\n- If goods X and Y are all inferior goods, then they would have a cross-price elasticity of -2 between each other, which is not the case as we are given a positive elasticity.\n\n(C) Goods X and Y are complementary goods.\n- If goods X and Y are complementary goods, then when the price of one increases, people would buy more of the other one, resulting in a negative cross-price elasticity.\n\n(D) Goods X and Y are substitute goods.\n- If goods X and Y are substitute goods, then when the price of one increases, people would buy less of the other one, resulting in a negative cross-price elasticity. However, we are given a positive elasticity, meaning the products are related in such a way that an increase in the price of one leads to an increase in demand for the other.\n\nStep 4: Choose the correct answer\nThe cross-price elasticity of +2.0 means that goods X and Y are related in such a way that when the price of one increases, the demand for the other goods increases at a higher rate (2% instead of 1%). This is consistent with substitute goods, which increases demand for the other when the price of one increases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(D) goods X and Y are substitute goods.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(B) Highly inelastic demand curve.\n\nStep 1: Understand the context of the question.\n- The question mentions oligopoly, which is a market structure that consists of a few interdependent firms, all with significant market power.\n- It also mentions rival firms and price decreases. In an oligopolistic market, rival firms often set their prices to compete with each other in response to market conditions.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the demand curve options.\n- A perfectly horizontal demand curve means that the demand for a product is totally unresponsive to any changes in its price. This is not relevant to the rival firms in the oligopolistic market, as they still react to price changes from their competitors.\n- A highly elastic demand curve suggests that demand for a product is sensitive to price changes, both decreases and increases. This is not what is described in the question where rival firms only follow price decreases and not price increases.\n- A demand curve consisting of two discontinuous segments is not consistent with the concept of an oligopoly, where firms operate in a competitive market in which rival firms respond to changes in price.\n\nStep 3: Select the correct answer.\n- A highly inelastic demand curve (option B) best describes the situation in which oligopolists face a response to their rival firms' price decreases, but not increases, because highly inelastic demand curves are less concerned with price changes. If the demand is highly inelastic, a decrease in price may only have a small effect on demand, leading rival firms not to follow price increases.",

Wages are affected by factors like supply and demand in the labor market, not by manufacturing outputs.\n\n(D) Racial discrimination: Racial discrimination is a basis for wage differentials, as employers might discriminate against people of a certain race or ethnicity by denying equal pay for equal work or giving more opportunities to individuals from their own group.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(C) Increase in production of SUVs.",
