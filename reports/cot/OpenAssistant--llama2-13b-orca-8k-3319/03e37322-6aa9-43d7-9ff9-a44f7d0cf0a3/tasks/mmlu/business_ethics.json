            "question": "_______ such as bitcoin are becoming increasingly mainstream and have a whole host of associated ethical implications, for example, they are______ and more ______. However, they have also been used to engage in _______.\n\n(A) Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime\n(B) Traditional currency, Cheap, Unsecure, Charitable giving\n(C) Cryptocurrencies, Cheap, Secure, Financial crime\n(D) Traditional currency, Expensive, Unsecure, Charitable giving",

            "model_answer": "Let us break down the question and analyze it step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we understand that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are the main topic of the question, so we can infer that option (A) is related to the question.\n\n2. Next, the question mentioned that these cryptocurrencies have associated ethical implications. One of these implications, according to the question, is that they are becoming increasingly mainstream. This implies that they are affordable and accessible to a wider audience, so we can deduce that they should be \"Cheap\".\n\n3. The question also states that these cryptocurrencies are secure. This suggests they follow strong security protocols, keeping them safe from unauthorized access. So, \"Secure\" is also a correct answer.\n\n4. Independent of the context, but essential to the overall conversation, the question connects these cryptocurrencies to unexpected uses and activities, such as engaging in financial crime. So, the last part of the question is related to engaging in criminal activities with cryptocurrencies.\n\nNow we have all three options.\n\n(A) Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime\n(B) Traditional currency, Cheap, Unsecure, Charitable giving\n(C) Cryptocurrencies, Cheap, Secure, Financial crime\n(D) Traditional currency, Expensive, Unsecure, Charitable giving\n\nThe letter to choose is the first letter of the first word of the answer (A).\n\nSo, capitalizing the first letter and closing the parentheses, the answer is:\n\n(A)",

            "question": "Typical advertising regulatory bodies suggest, for example that adverts must not: encourage _________, cause unnecessary ________ or _____, and must not cause _______ offence.\n\n(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial\n(B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious\n(C) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial\n(D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (B). Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious.\n\nAnd let me explain step by step why this is so.\n\nThe question asks for filling in the blanks in a statement about advertising regulatory bodies' suggesting regulations about adverts that must not do certain things. These things concern public safety, wellbeing or offence. \n\nFirst, we consider option (A): Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial.\nUnsafe practices - this does relate to the advertising regulation that adverts must not be unsafe or promote dangerous practices. However, both Wants and Trivial do not harmonize with the theme that the question is likely discussing.\n\nHence we move onto option (B): Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious.\nUnsafe practices - as in option (A) relates to advertising regulations that adverts must not promote certain unsafe or dangerous practices. This is a theme that advertising regulatory bodies typically set rules around.\n\nDistress - although there is a line between 'distress' and material offense or irresponsible adverts, there isn't usually a rule that states \u2018ads cannot cause distress'. This implies that 'distress' is an unclear term to dictate in an advertising regulation.\n\nFear - could relate to a safety issue, like with \u2018Unsafe practices\u2019, but regulations typically protect public safety in adverts. However, the word 'Fear' alone doesn't give a clear statement about responsible techniques in adverts or diffident aspects.\n\nSerious - is a bit vague but could potentially be related to ads that discriminate, ostracize or create social problems, which advertising regulatory body should avoid objectionable societal issues. So 'Serious' indirectly refers to beliefs or values that shouldn\u2019t be violated by ads causing offense to certain groups or individuals.\n\nTherefore, the best option that fits all the parameters in the question (Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious) is option (B), so the final answer is (B) because it covers the safety, offence and respect issues advertising regulatory bodies lay down in their rules.",

In this context, fluidity is associated with the flexible and adaptive nature of the working patterns.\n\n3. Flexible means \"able to be easily changed, modified, or adapted.\" It suggests being able to easily adjust and adapt to different situations and tasks.\n\n4. Modern refers to something that is current, in the latest style, or new fashion.

It only suggests continuous change or progress.\n- Fluid: This matches with the idea of fluidity and adapting to each situation. It focuses on the temporal, spatial, and task-related aspects.\n- Flexible: This word could be a synonym of fluid. However, it might not characterize the temporal, spatial, and task-related aspects of the working practices as accurately.\n- Modern: This generally implies new or latest working practices, but does not focus on the adaptability aspects of the given question.\n\nConsidering the context of the question and the meanings of the words provided, the best answer is:\n\n(B) Fluid",
