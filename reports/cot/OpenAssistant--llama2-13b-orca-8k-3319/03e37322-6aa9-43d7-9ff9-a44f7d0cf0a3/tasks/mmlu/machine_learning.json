Its variance can be lower than other unbiased estimators in specific scenarios. Thus, the statement can be true in some cases.\n\nStatement 2: The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\nAdaBoost is an algorithm for improving the performance of machine learning models. It assigns certain coefficients (\u03b1) to classifiers, and it aims to reduce the error rates of classifiers. The assigned \u03b1 values should be non-negative, as AdaBoost is using an additive scheme (summation of coefficients) to reach the target error rate. Therefore, the statement is true.\n\nWolfs13",

This is a correct statement. SVMs (Support Vector Machines) work by finding the best hyperplane (Divide input space into two parts) which maximizes the margin between the classes. This separation maximizes the distance between the closest examples and ensures we capture the most relevant information in order to classify them accurately. The resulting decision function tends to have a good (sharp and not overlapping) probability distribution over the labels.\n\nStatement 2: We would expect the support vectors to remain the same in general as we move from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels.\n- False. The support vectors don't remain the same when moving from a linear kernel to a higher order polynomial kernel. SVMs work by maximizing the margin or separation between examples, and the support vectors are the examples that lie closest to the decision boundary (the line or plane separating the classes). As the kernel type changes during SVM optimization, typically the number of support vectors changes as well. A change in the kernel also changes the geometry of the hyperplane, and thus the support vectors that ensure good classification performance.

The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is a method used to find maximum likelihood estimation for a probability distribution from data. It does not always increase with successive iterations, but more likely it will.\n\nStatement 2 is about a disadvantage of Q-learning. Q-learning is a learning method for the discrete-time finite-state Markov decision processes.

The gradient is the rate at which the cost function is changing based on the change in the model parameters. In our scenario, we have a cost function with an update for one gradient descent iteration.\n\nNow, let's analyze the costs:\n\n1. Constant (C): The per-iteration cost is equal to the update cost C, and independent of data set size.\n\n2. O(1): In this step we compute the gradient g for our cost function. Each iteration, we will store the updated gradient g in this vector.\n\n3.

Thus, the probability distribution function, p(x), in which it is the probability of getting x (a range of values) must be between 0 and 1, combining to 1 for all possible values of x. It will always sum up to 1 in total sum as it represents the chance or probability of all the values excluding any null values (0).\n\nStatement 2 is true because a decision tree is a supervised learning method for machine learning, which is the process of finding patterns analyzed from a dataset. It learns or \"learns\" about the structure in as a form of the decision tree, essentially a branching-modified tree, that organizes the data to make predictions that could classify or sort data into two categories: yes or no, definitely, possibilities, etc. This is done by minimizing what is known as \"information gain\", which is used as a statistical measure for decision-making during the construction of such trees. It's like deciding what is probably really good or really bad based on hard evidence (rather than assumptions) and considering each value in that probability distribution. It does not involve \"maximizing\" probability measures to increase its sum, like an adjacency diagram, but instead, the key formula in information gain aids for minimizing it, which results in a decision or prediction tree outcome. \n\nSo, both statements 1 and 2 are true.
