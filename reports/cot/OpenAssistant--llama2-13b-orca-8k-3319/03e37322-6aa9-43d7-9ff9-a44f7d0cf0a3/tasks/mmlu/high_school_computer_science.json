            "model_answer": "We will evaluate x << 3 in Python to find the answer step-by-step.\n\n1. First, let's examine x and its value. In Python 3 (where Python uses binary numerals), x = 1, which, in binary is 01, and it represents an 8-bit integer with a value of 1. \n\n2. Next, we need to determine what 3, in Python representation, will be. Since the number 3 corresponds to 0011 in Python 3, it represents an 8-bit integer with a value of 3.\n\n3. Now, let's give x << 3. This means we are performing a bit shift left operation on x by 3 bits i.e., X takes the 3 most significant bits of X and discards the other bits, which in this case would be the Least Significant Bit (LSB, LSB refers to the bits with the least weight in the binary representation area).\n\n4. Applying this operation to x = 1 (01), tellingly its 3 least significant bits would be 1.\n\n5. 3 x None = 0\n\nConsequently, x << 3 would yield a Falsey value in Python, and thus, our final answer is '(A) 1' because the answer is represented as a single letter with parentheses around it.",

The user's browser must request each packet in order until all packets are received.\n\nThis is because when the user enters a Web address in a browser and a request for a file is sent to a Web server, the file is broken into smaller parts called packets. These packets are then sent by the server to the user's browser, which needs to receive all packets in order to reconstruct the file. Once the browser has all packets, it reassembles them and presents the file to the user. This process typically happens across multiple connections (unsuccessful attempts, as in option C) which exist for increasing efficiency, and even if one packet does not reach the user, only that packet may be lost, so the process is not always directly as described in option D.",
