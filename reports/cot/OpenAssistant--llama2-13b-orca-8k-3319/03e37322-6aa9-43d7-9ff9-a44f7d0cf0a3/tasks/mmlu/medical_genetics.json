            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what Robertsonian translocation is. \n\nRobertsonian translocation is a type of chromosomal abnormality in which a segment of a chromosome is transferred from one chromosome to another, often resulting in reattached chromosomes with incorrect alignment. This occurs when chromosomes break and exchange small parts during cell division, creating an altered chromosome arrangement.\n\nNow let's examine the answer options step-by-step:\n\n(A) Telomeres are the protective caps at the end of chromosomes that play an essential role in maintaining chromosome stability and protecting DNA from degradation. Although telomere shortening may occur in people with Robertsonian translocations, the fusion does not occur at the telomeres themselves.\n\n(B) Centromeres are the regions within chromosomes where the DNA is wound and coiled to form a structure known as a chromatin mat, and they do not undergo fusion during Robertsonian translocation.\n\n(C) Histones are proteins that help in organizing the DNA within chromosomes, but they are not involved in the fusion process of Robertsonian translocation.\n\n(D) Ends of long arms may refer to chromosomal ends where DNA is more accessible for the process of recombination. In the case of Robertsonian translocation, the fusion does not occur at the tips, but within the chromosome, leading to an altered chromosome arrangement.\n\nThe desired letter for the fusion location in case of Robertsonian translocation is - (D) ends of the long arms.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To find the expected frequency of affected females in a population with an X-linked recessive condition, we can use the theorem of genetic counting: the number of affected individuals in a generation equals the sum of the frequencies of two alleles individually affected.\n\nLet's assume we have a population with the following alleles: A - unaffected, a - affected males, and a - affected females. We know that (a + a) is part of the total population (the sum of the alleles with the condition).\n\nA generation in humans is assumed to be 25 years. Therefore, the total population is assumed to be (25 x 1000 x 1000) = 2.5 x 10^9 individuals. We know that one in ten (0.1) males is affected by the condition, so the number of affected males is (2.5 x 10^9) x (0.1) = 25,000 affected males.\n\nSince both males and females are affected individually by an X-linked condition, we can do the same calculation for the number of affected females. The affected females are still (2.5 x 10^9) x (0.1) = 25,000 affected females.\n\nNow, to calculate the total number of both males and females affected by the condition: \nA (total) = (Affected males + affected females)\nA (total) = 25,000 (males) + 25,000 (females)\n\nNow we can find the female: male ratio by dividing the number of affected females by the number of affected males.\n\nRatio = (25,000 females) / (25,000 males) = 1 / 1\n\nFinally, to find the expected frequency of affected females, we can divide the total number of affected individuals by the total population.\n\nExpected frequency for females = (2,500,000) / (A (total) + 1)\nExpected frequency for females = (2,500,000) / (1,000,000,000 + 1)\nExpected frequency for females = (2,500,000) / (2,500,000,001)\nExpected frequency for females \u2248 0.001\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 0.001.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to learn about the rules of DNA molecule pairs. These rules are called the 'Base Pairing Rules' and they are what helps us determine which base pairs with which. \n\n1. Even though adenine and guanine and cytosine and thymine both are made of single letters A, T, G, and C, their function is opposite in pairing. \n\n2. Cytosine, which represents a \"C\", is positioned between the two bars on the DNA backbone, so when a DNA strand is flipped, there should be a thymine that represents a \"T\" opposite.\n\n3. In contrast, Adenine, represented by \"A\", is wedged between two thymine's, so in its complementary molecule there should be cytosine.\n\n4. Purines (adenine and guanine) crossing with pyrimidines (cytosine, uracil, and thymine): adenine (A) and guanine (G) usually pair with purines, but adenine specifically pairs with thymine while guanine pairs with cytosine.\n\nTherefore, based on these rules, the base that adenine normally pairs with is:\n\n(C) thymine.",

The symptoms include fever (hyperpyrexia), muscle breakdown, and increase in body temperature.\n\nStep 2: Determine the pattern of inheritance based on the genetic trait distribution.\n- Autosomal recessive inheritance is when the condition requires two copies of the altered gene; one from each parent, for the individual to have the disorder.\n- Autosomal dominant inheritance is when the condition requires only one copy of the altered gene from one parent for the individual to have the disorder.\n- X-linked dominant/recessive inheritance depends on the presence/absence of the gene on the X chromosome. This pattern is different for males and females. \n\nStep 3: Understand which inheritance pattern fits malignant hyperthermia.\nAs malignant hyperthermia's primary symptoms are absence of muscle activity and occurrence of muscle breakdown in response to anesthetics, analgesics, and/or exercise, it is reasonable to consider the inheritance pattern based on this context.\n\nStep 4: Determine the correct pattern of inheritance.\nMalignant hyperthermia is an autosomal dominant disorder as one copy of the SDH gene changes is enough for an individual to have the condition.\n\nFinal step: Output the answer in parenthesis.\n(A) Autosomal dominant",

This could imply that only part of the mapping process is restricted, while other parts may still be active.\n\n(B) The statement says that the mapping proceeded more successfully due to large numbers of DNA markers becoming available. This information suggests that the mapping process went smoothly, perhaps made easier with larger amounts of data.\n\n(C) The statement says that the number of linkage groups is about twice the number of chromosomes.

            "correct_answer": 3,

Intergenerational transmission refers to the transmission of traits, behaviors, or experiences from one generation to the next, often through the process of genetic inheritance and environmental factors.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options step-by-step:\n\n1. War: Although war can have a significant impact on families and generations, it is not the direct cause of intergenerational transmission. However, the stress and trauma experienced can cause long-term mental and physical health issues that can be passed down through the family.\n\n2. Natural disasters: Natural disasters can lead to immediate adverse consequences for families and generations, such as property damage, displacement, and loss of life. However, long-term intergenerational transmission is not primarily a result of exposure to natural disasters but rather the impact on social, economic, and health systems.\n\n3. Hunger: Malnutrition during pregnancy and early childhood can lead to long-term effects on health, intelligence, and social development. Hunger is a direct factor that can impact generations, potentially affecting gene expression and transmission.\n\n4. All of these: This option includes war, natural disasters, and hunger. As we have analyzed all three options, we can see that hunger is the only option directly contributing to the transmission of traits and experiences between generations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) all of these, with the most significant factor being (B) natural disasters.",

If it is not treated, phenylalanine builds up in the blood, leading to several health problems and intellectual disabilities.\n\nUntreated PKU passes from a mother to her child. The chance of having a child with PKU increases with each pregnancy, as the risk is 50% with each pregnancy.

As such, it is most closely related to RNA processing mutations, which involve errors in the transcription or processing of RNA molecules, directly affecting the protein they code for.\n\nA) Nonsense mutations involve a premature stop codon which leads to the termination of translation before the production of a fully functional protein. This is different from exon skipping.\nB) Regulatory mutations affect gene regulation, but they don't directly impact the reading or processing of RNA like exon skipping does.\nD) Silent mutations are a type of DNA variation that does not change the amino acid sequence in the translated protein and do not involve the exon skipping process.",
