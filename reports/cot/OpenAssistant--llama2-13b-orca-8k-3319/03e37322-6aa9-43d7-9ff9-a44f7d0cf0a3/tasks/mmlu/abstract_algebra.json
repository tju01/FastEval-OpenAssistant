Non-Abelian means that if the group has no elements of order 2, then the group is not Abelian (i.e., bike-sharing society is non-Abelian). Since the factor group is obtained by dividing the group by a normal subgroup, and the Abelian character of the whole group does not change anything, it follows that the factor group is non-Abelian if the original group is non-Abelian. \n\nNow let's move on to Statement 2: \"If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\" Imagine families (H1, H2, and G): if H2 is a normal subgroup of H1 and H2 is also a normal subgroup of G, it means that H2, H1, and G are all related.\n\nTo give an example, take a toy train made up of three carriages: H2, H1, and G. First, make H1 empty by pulling all the carriages out. Then, put H1 back in and remove H2. Next, put H2 back in and remove H1. Finally, empty H2 and put G in its place. By doing each step, you create a chain of subgroups. If H2 is a regular feature of both H1 and G and can keep its status within each of these groups, it follows that H2 would be a normal subgroup in G.\n\nSo based on these explanations, the answer is A) True, True.",

In simple terms, it is the minimum number of new elements needed to form the new field.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the transcendence degree of the extended field.\n\nThe elements of the extension field are sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) (which is a rational number because it is the sum of two rational numbers) and sqrt(2) - sqrt(3). We'll try to find a polynomial with integer coefficients that can represent neither of these elements in Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)).\n\nSince Q is a field, its characteristic is 0. Consider the polynomial x^n - 1 in Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)), for a prime number n, that cannot be written as the sum of the squares of two rational numbers in Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)). In other words, we are looking for a prime number n that does not have a representation like (x - 1)^2 = (y - sqrt(2)^2)^2 + (z - sqrt(3)^2)^2 in Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)). If there were such a prime, it would only take n new elements to form Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)).\n\nHowever, there is no prime number less than (the characteristic of Q) = 0 that does not belong to any field extending the rational numbers. During our search, a prime n belonging in any extension field containing Q would have a \"wholly different\" representation as the difference of two squares in Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)), because (1/n)^2 remains the same. Therefore, there is no contradiction. If our field extension had the degree B, then up to a conjugation there would be a prime n belonging to Q^B and not also belonging to Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)).\n\nFrom this example, we are able to conclude that there is no prime n less than the characteristic of the field which doesn't belong to any field extension which contains it.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q is 6, which is (D).",
