            "model_answer": "To answer this question, first let's break it down:\n\n1. Understand the hunting hypothesis: The docility hypothesis states that certain individuals are more docile or submissive when they are exposed to a high level of environmental demands. This hypothesis could suggest that these individuals have problems translating certain stimuli or interacting with their surroundings, which may lead to this submissive behavior.\n\n2. Compare it to the correct statement: Case (A) focuses on vulnerability, rather than docility (\"Those with low capabilities are more vulnerable to environmental demands\u201c). However, it is the closest to the docility hypothesis, referring to weakness or susceptibility.\n\n3. Check for the opposite statement: Case (D) talks about less vulnerability or capability, which is not related to the willingness to submit, nor of being more likely to be vulnerable or submissive to environmental demands.\n\nSo, combining all the information above, Case (A) is closest to representing the true docility hypothesis:\n\n(A) Those with low capabilities are more vulnerable to environmental demands",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to identify the factor that is effective in improving normal memory. Let's analyze the options step-by-step:\n\n(A) Aerobic exercise: Engaging in regular aerobic exercise is known to have a positive impact on cognition and memory. It helps to improve the flow of blood to the brain, which helps to contribute to a healthy brain and improve memory function. Thus, this option seems plausible.\n\n(B) Taking acetylcholine: This is a neurotransmitter that is found in the brain, playing a significant role in memory and cognition. Supplementing with acetylcholine in some cases might improve memory but also cause negative side effects and is not a universally accepted solution.\n\n(C) Taking gingko: Ginkgo is an herb that is often taken to improve memory and cognitive function. It is believed to have neuroprotective effects and can help with brain circulation. Therefore, gingko is another possible option to improve memory.\n\n(D) Increasing social contact: Increasing social contacts could indeed improve memory and cognitive abilities. Social interaction promotes mental stimulation, emotional well-being, and can even help to manage stress, all of which can be beneficial for memory.\n\nBased on the analysis, options (A), (C), and (D) seem likely to improve normal memory.

In this context, the statement \"both play an important role\" is well-supported, as there is some support for genetic predispositions and environmental influences.\n\n(B) Mechanistic vs. Organismic: This focuses on the models that scientists use to understand how living systems work. The mechanistic model emphasizes well-defined structures and processes, while the organismic model looks at the systems as whole entities. This question does not necessarily relate to the statement \"both play an important role,\" as it is more about choosing one model based on the system's complexity.\n\n(C) Continuity vs. Discontinuity: This pertains to the field of linguistics, psychology, and other disciplines, which study the assimilation of native language into a child's developing linguistic system - whether they establish native patterns (continuity) or new patterns (discontinuity).

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) Practice regular aerobic exercise\n\nTo answer this question, let's go through each option step by step.\n\n(A) Practice regular aerobic exercise:\nExercise is known to improve cognitive function and overall health. Although aerobic exercises primarily impact cardiovascular health, they can still lead to benefits in various areas, including improved cognitive functions such as faster reaction time. As we age, our muscles tend to weaken, and blood flow is slower which can lead to slower reaction times, but regular exercise helps to maintain muscle strength and overall health. This can help counteract or reduce the difference in reaction time between younger and older adults.\n\n(B) Lift weights on a regular schedule:\nWeight lifting focuses on improving strength, specifically muscular strength. While strength may contribute to overall reaction time, it isn't the primary factor. As we age, strength might also decrease, but it isn't the primary reason for slower reaction times. The main reason still remains the slower cognitive processes.\n\n(C) Consume large quantities of vitamins:\nAlthough vitamins can be beneficial for overall health, consuming massive quantities of them is not recommended. It's more likely that a well-balanced diet supplemented with vitamins is more beneficial than hyper-intake of specific nutrients for reaction time. Additionally, even if you are deficient in a specific nutrient, it's unlikely to dramatically improve reaction time by simply consuming excessive amounts.\n\n(D) Practice Tai chi:\nTai chi is an ancient Chinese martial art that involves gentle, flowing movements and meditation. While it is believed to have many health benefits, there is no direct evidence that practicing it improves reaction time. In fact, it is more likely that the slow, deliberate movements of Tai chi would make reaction time even slower.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Practice regular aerobic exercise because it can help improve overall health and cognitive capabilities, including reaction time, as compared to the other options (B), (C), and (D).",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand the different theories of senescence and their points of view.\n\nProgrammed Theories: These theories believe that senescence is planned and follows a predetermined (genetically founded) path, often referred to as \"program.\" This group of theories suggests that there is some kind of genetic plan followed by the organism which determines when aging starts and whether a specific organ or tissue is affected. An example would be the concept of \" telomeres \" - the end portions of chromosomes that can be damaged with age, shortening cell lifespan.\n\nUnprogrammed (or Non-programmed) Theories: These theories believe that senescence is the outcomes of different factors like damage accumulation, metabolism and other environmental factors. Because 'program' doesn't come into the picture here, the cause of changes that lead to senescence can be attributed to several factors like aging, response to evolutionary pressures. Eg. - theories of error catastrophe, Hayflick's limit, etc.\n\nNow, to answer the question:\n\nThe major difference between programmed and unprogrammed theories of senescence is that programmed theories (Claim that senescence follows a predetermined plan)\n\n(C)",
