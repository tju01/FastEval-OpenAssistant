            "model_answer": "This instructional strategy best describes an approach by the teacher to jointly create a understanding of a specific genre (in this case, short stories). Considering the steps: checking the list of options A) Conferencing, B) Discipline-based inquiry, C) Self-Regulated Strategy Development, and D) Introduction-Body-Conclusion strategy, we deduce that the teacher's'style' of teaching implies a more active 'participation' that is a typical element of inquiry-based and active learning strategies.\n\nIn active learning'styles', teachers encourage students to be more engaged and take active role in their own learning. Students are not only listening to but also listening to understand, and the key to this being done is by ask questions and facilitating discussions and group work. Which of the available options match this personalised and inquiry-based approach?\n\nOption B, Discipline-based inquiry, perfectly fits the 'goal' of this 'activity' as the teacher is aiding students to develop their skills and understanding in an in-depth and methodical manner, as you'd in scientific research. It collectively also implies an instructor guiding individuals, ensuring they are at ease and actively participating in the exchange of ideas. \n\nAll these reasons lead to the conclusion that the appropriate answer is \n\n(B) Discipline-based inquiry",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to identify the temperature at which paper typically burns. \n\nTo determine the temperature at which paper burns, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start by researching the basic fact: chemically, paper is primarily made of cellulose, which has a decomposition point of around 451 degrees Fahrenheit.\n2. Paper combusts at lower temperatures than this, as a flame ignites the paper and helps it burn more effectively.\n3. However, there is not a specific standard temperature for paper burning.\n4. In practical terms, paper commonly burns between 400-500 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nNow we can provide the answer:\n\n(D) 451 degrees",

This suggests they are not being taught in a large-class format, but rather in a personalized or guided setting.\n\n2) As students read a text or a book that is unfamiliar to them, it implies that they are learning how to engage with new material, which is common for beginners.\n\n3) The teacher works with the students to teach them how to use a variety of reading strategies. This demonstrates that they are actively helping the students to understand the text, term which is needed for them to advance.\n\nGiven these factors, the reading approach described is (C) Guided reading, as it provides a personalized learning environment and helps beginner readers develop their skills.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand the main factor determining the resistance of a material. \n\nThe resistance of a material depends on the resistance per unit length, which depends, among other things, on temperature. This means that for a given metal, its resistance will change with the change in temperature.\n\nNow let's analyze each of the provided materials:\n\n(A) Copper: Copper is a metallic element and its resistance per unit length does change slightly (though not very much) with temperature. So it is not the least affected by temperature changes.\n\n(B) Carbon: Graphite is pure carbon in an allotrope, which is a form the element takes depending on its physical properties. In its crystalline, graphitic form, its resistance is very low (like a conductor) and its resistance doesn't change much with temperature. Here, carbon can be considered to have the least affected resistance per unit length by temperature changes compared to the other materials.\n\n(C) Germanium: Germanium is a semiconductor material, and its resistance per unit length does change significantly with temperature.\n\n(D) Silicon: Similar to germanium, silicon is also a semiconductor material, and thus its resistance also changes significantly with temperature.\n\nNow that we've analyzed the materials, we can determine which one has the least affected resistance. The least affected resistance per unit length mostly goes to (B) Carbon. So the answer is (B) Carbon.\n\n(B) Carbon",

Dustin Hoffman is also in the film, but he plays the character of a suspicious police officer, and not Ripley. Ben Affleck is also an actor, but not from this movie.
