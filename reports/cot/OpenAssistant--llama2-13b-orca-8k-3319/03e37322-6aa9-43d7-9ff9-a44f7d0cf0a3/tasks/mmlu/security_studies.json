            "model_answer": "The responsible answer is to lay out the main concepts related to the responsibility to protect, and then compare them to the given options.\n\nThe responsibility to protect (R2P) is an international political commitment which the United Nations member states endorsed in 2005. It emphasized that all states are responsible for the protection of their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. Based on these ideas, we can analyze the given options:\n\n(A) The responsibility to prevent. This concept is one of the three pillars of R2P. It emphasizes that states have a responsibility to take action to prevent these atrocities before they occur, not only when they are occurring. Thus, it boosts prevention efforts.\n\n(B) The responsibility to react. Similar to (A), the responsibility to react is one of the key principles of R2P. After the initial steps are taken to prevent such threats, it emphasizes that if early warning signs of such actions develop, it is one's responsibility to react or intervene. The main idea behind this is to ensure timely and appropriate action is taken when prevention fails.\n\n(C) The responsibility to remain sovereign. This concept stipulates that states are responsible for their own actions and decisions, but does not have anything to do with preventing or reacting to the others' actions. It therefore does not fall under the responsibility to protect umbrella of principles.\n\n(D) The responsibility to rebuild. This principle follows the responsibility to prevent and react. Once a crisis or emergency situation has occurred, the responsibility to rebuild encourages states to take steps to restore or rehabilitate communities and societies affected.\n\nIn conclusion, out of the given options (A) The responsibility to prevent and (B) The responsibility to react fall within the realm of the responsibility to protect principles. As for (C) The responsibility to remain sovereign it does not relate to R2P, and (D) The responsibility to rebuild is a subsequent part of it.\n\nOutput - (C) The responsibility to remain sovereign",

            "question": "Can environmental changes be reconciled with national security interests?\n\n(A) Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, leads to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs.\n(B) Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.\n(D) All of these options.",

            "model_answer": "A) A, B) B, (D) D\n\nThere are steps to reconciling environmental changes with national security interests. First, environmental challenges to economic growth can lead to diversification and research, ultimately resulting in technological advancements that bolster military programs. This helps to mitigate potential negative impacts on national security. Also, while environmental changes may weaken a country's economic base, impacting its military capacity, they are still controllable within that same country. This means that environmental problems are principally internal, where a country can control and adapt to such changes. More so, external military threats remain constant and are unlinked to environmental changes hence can be managed separately as a primary concern. Lastly, it's necessary to consider all of these options (A, B, and D) when devising solutions to reconcile environmental changes with national security interests. Because each of these options holds relevant and viable solutions that can be synergized for a more effective approach.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

Option E, Privatization, is indeed not among the 10 steps of the Washington Consensus.\n\nThe solution, therefore, is to select option (E) as the incorrect notification that does not belong to the 10 steps of the Washington Consensus.",
