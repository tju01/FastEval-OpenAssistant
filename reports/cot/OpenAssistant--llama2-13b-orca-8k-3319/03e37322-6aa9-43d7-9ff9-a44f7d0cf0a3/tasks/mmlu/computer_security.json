            "model_answer": "To determine which style of fuzzer is more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in the program, let's examine the workings of each fuzzer type:\n\n(A) Generational fuzzers: This type of fuzzer starts with a basic input and iteratively produces new input sets by combining elements from the previous input set. It focuses on mutating the input data and may generate increasingly complex input structures over its iterations.\n\n(B) Blackbox fuzzers: This type of fuzzer aims to find maximal coverage in the program by generating random input values or relying on advanced techniques such as machine learning or intelligent algorithms. While it may be slightly more unpredictable in its input generation, it can approach every line of code in a comprehensive way.\n\n(C) Whitebox fuzzers: This type of fuzzer uses internal knowledge of the program, such as its control flow graph, line coverage data, and compiler optimization techniques, to effectively guide the fuzzing process. It can be much more targeted in its input generation, focusing on specific areas of the program to improve efficacy.\n\n(D) Mutation-based fuzzers: This type of fuzzer specifically focuses on mutating (altering) the program input to induce errors, defects, or other unexpected situations. This may not necessarily include all lines of code in the program but can systematically explore the ones that could be more likely to crash or otherwise exhibit bugs.\n\nBased on the analysis of each fuzzer type, it's challenging to pinpoint a definitive answer regarding which style is more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in a program. Comprehensive exploration can vary depending on the specific program, the fuzzer, and the input generation method used. With that, the best answer is:\n\n(B) Blackbox fuzzers.",

            "question": "MIT\u2019s Kerberos KDC server has a maximum ticket lifetime of 24 hours (for most user principals). What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n\n(A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\n(B) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\n(C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n(D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n\nThe Kerberos KDC server\u2019s duty is ensuring that only valid tickets are accepted, preventing attempts to seek for services through expired tickets. When a client attempts to connect to a server using a Kerberos ticket, the server first verifies the ticket\u2019s credibility by checking its expiration time and its expiration date against the server\u2019s current clock time.\n\nIf the expiration time on the ticket is in the future, which means it is still valid, the server allows the client to access the requested service. However, if the expiration date is in the past, which indicates the ticket is now expired, the server denies authorization for accessing the services, effectively preventing the use of expired tickets. \n\nThe server essentially knows how old the ticket is and compares that to the current time. Whereas, the KDC server's job is to grant or deny access based on the ticket's status: active or expired.\n\n(A) is incorrect because the Kerberos server does not directly establish new connections. It is the clients that initiate such connections. It only authenticates logins.\n\n(B) is incorrect as the tickets are not merely used for authentication but to request services. If tickets are invalid, not only they cannot be used for authentication but also for requesting services.\n\n(D) is incorrect as the tickets, and not just the servers, are compared. The server only messages the KDC server which in turn validates and returns a response on the ticket's status. So, it is the KDC server that does the job. Therefore, the part about sending a message is incorrect and the way it works is already described in (C).",

Darknet, Freenet, ARPANET, Stuxnet, and Internet are all related to online networking and technology.\n\nDarknet: A part of the Internet that is only accessible via special software or configurations, often used to conduct activities that are illegal or otherwise not allowed on regular databases.\n\nARPANET: The first-generation Internet, which was developed by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s. It was a network of computer networks and existed before the mainstream Internet.\n\nFreenet: A free social networking software designed to enable people to share any kind of information without censorships, with strong encryption features that enable anonymity.\n\nStuxnet: A computer worm discovered in June 2010 that targeted industrial control systems (ICS). The worm entered the ICS undetected, causing physical damage, boiler explosions, and other harm to the systems it infiltrated.\n\nInternet: The online network of networks that connects billions of devices worldwide, allowing communication, data exchange, and access to resources on a global scale.\n\nNow, let's try to find the correct answer.\n\nARPANET is not related to the darknet as it was a public, government-sponsored network, and darknet was designed to remain anonymous. However, provided that we're considering the darknet as a separate network, Freenet fits the criteria. Freenet allows users to exchange data anonymously, which is a feature commonly associated with darknet networks.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n(A) Freenet is also a part of darknet that is employed for transferring files anonymously.",

            "model_answer": "B) No storage check in the external memory\n\nExplanation:\n\nWhen developers use languages like C and C++, they build applications directly interacting with the memory of the computer. These languages don't have inbuilt mechanisms to check the boundaries or storage of data in the programming language itself. Due to this, when a programmer is writing code, they can inadvertently write data out of the allocated memory space and into adjacent memory, which is controlled by the operating system of the computer, leading to the condition known as a \"buffer overflow.\" This means there's no board-level check that will help to prevent this error, unlike a higher-level language like Java or Python, which have a garbage collector in the language itself that automatically performs these kinds of checks. This is a big vulnerability, making it prone to Buffer-overflow attacks.",

A MiTM attack is a type of cyberattack where the attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. In the context of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method, a successful MiTM attack could compromise the security of the exchanged keys, which can lead to sensitive data compromise.\n\nNow, let's understand the alternatives:\n\n(A) Joined: Not relevant to the purposes of the question.\n(B) Authenticated: In a MITM attack, attackers are usually forging authentication between two parties. This point is relevant since it shows how authenticated keys can be affected.\n(C) Submitted: Not relevant to the purposes of the question.\n(D) Shared: Relevant to the key exchange method (Diffie-Hellman), indicating the importance of not leaking these shared keys.\n\nNow, putting all this together, we can state:\n\nDifferie-Hellman method's security can be endangered if two parties are not\n\nStep 1: Identify the attack\n- MiTM\n\nStep 2: Assess the outcome of the attack\n- Compromising security of exchanged keys\n\nStep 3: Analyze the alternatives in terms of mitigating effects\n- (B) Authenticated: Lessens the impact since authenticated keys are harder to extract\n- (D) Shared: Exposing these keys can compromise the method, as the aim of the attack is to compromise the security of the exchanged keys\n\nBased on the explanation above, the answer is (D) Shared.",
