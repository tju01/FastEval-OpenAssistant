            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Murtis can be translated as (A) Offerings.\n\nLet me explain the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The word \"murtis\" is derived from the Sanskrit language of Hinduism.\n2. In Hinduism, a murtis is an object that represents a deity, which is typically worshiped as a divine presence.\n3. Since a murtis is an object, a more appropriate translation in terms of meaning is an \"offering\" (A) rather than a \"prayer\" (B), an \"apparition\" (C), or an \"idol\" (D).\n\nThus, the correct answer is (A) Offerings.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's go through the options one by one and determine which options are most likely to be associated with naturalists who focus on natural elements and processes.\n\n(A) Daoism: Daoism is a philosophical and religious tradition that has a strong emphasis on the harmonious integration of humans with nature. Naturalists who focus on natural elements and processes might be associated with this framework.\n\n(B) Yin-Yang School: The Yin-Yang School of thought is based on the ancient Chinese philosophical concept of the interplay of two opposite but complementary forces, yin and yang. This school of thought does not solely focus on natural elements and processes but rather on the broader relationship between nature and humanity.\n\n(C) Mengzi: Mengzi is an ancient Chinese philosopher known for his teachings on virtue, moral conduct, and the importance of self-cultivation. While his work is influential in the development of Chinese thought, it does not specifically focus on the study of natural elements and processes.\n\n(D) Humanistic Buddhism: Humanistic Buddhism is a modern movement that emphasizes the principles of compassion, non-violence, and social justice, rather than primarily focusing on natural elements and processes.\n\nBased on the analysis, naturalists who concentrate on natural elements and processes would most likely be associated with (A) Daoism.\n\n(A)",
