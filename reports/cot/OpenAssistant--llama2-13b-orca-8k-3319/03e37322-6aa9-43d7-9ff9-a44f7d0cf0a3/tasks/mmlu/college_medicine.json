            "question": "A police officer carries out hundreds of traffic stops every year. When his supervisor is reviewing the officer\u2019s records for the past year, he notices that the officer is equally likely to stop people of various genders, ages, and races. However, he is significantly more likely to write tickets for middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes. When confronted with this fact, the officer truthfully states that he has no idea why that is, and that it must simply be a coincidence. Unbeknownst to the officer, this behavior is tied to the fact that these men look like his father, with whom he had an abusive relationship as a child. What psychological framework would directly address the unconscious bias in his behavior? \n\n(A) Behaviorist\n(B) Psychoanalytic\n(C) Cognitive behavioral\n(D) Humanistic",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "C) Cognitive Behavioral\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) would directly address the unconscious bias in the officer's behavior. CBT helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns, habits, and emotions that contribute to their unconscious biases. In this case, the officer could work with a therapist to recognize and challenge the beliefs and associations related to his abusive relationship with his father, thus potentially reducing the unconscious bias in his behavior during traffic stops.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we first need to understand the process of phosphocreatine resynthesis to determine the correct time frame.\n\nPhosphocreatine, commonly known as PCr, is a stored form of energy within muscles. It is formed by the combination of creatine (a nitrogenous compound) and phosphorus. When muscles undergo intensive exercise, this energy source is depleted.\n\nAfter an untrained person engages in high-intensity exercise, the resynthesis of phosphocreatine may occur within 1 to 2 minutes to maintain an optimal performance level. This activity is significantly impacted when there is a lack of dietary carbohydrates, which could slow down the PCr resynthesis process.\n\nWith an adapted body, athletes may be able to resynthesize faster. So, we can conclude the following:\n\n- An untrained person might take about 1-2 minutes to resynthesize phosphocreatine after high-intensity exercise. This places it in the time frame between 90 seconds (1.5 minutes) and 2 minutes.\n- A well-trained athlete might have a faster resynthesis rate.\n\nTaking into account the above information, the answer is:\n\n(C) about 1 minute.",

            "question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nBased on the article, which of the following statements is the author likely to agree with?\n\n(A) Heart surgery patients who cannot run on treadmills may benefit from sauna use.\n(B) Patients on a diet would benefit from sauna use.\n(C) Salt restriction would be equal to sauna use for hypertensive patients.\n(D) Patients with skin conditions may be cured with sauna use.",

This implies that DFP blocks or hinders the action of ACE by occupying its active site.\n\nStep 2: Identifying the type of inhibition\nThe type of inhibition describes how the inhibitor interacts with the enzyme. There are three main types of inhibition: competitive, noncompetitive, and irreversible.\n\nStep 3: Analyzing competitive inhibition\nCompetitive inhibition occurs when an inhibitor binds to the same site as the enzyme's substrate. In this case, because DFP binds to the active site of ACE, it prevents the substrate from binding, causing less active ACE.\n\nStep 4: Analyzing noncompetitive inhibition\nNoncompetitive inhibition occurs when the inhibitor does not bind to the same site as the enzyme's substrate but still inhibits the enzyme's function. DFP does not competitively inhibit ACE because binding at the active site prevents the substrate from binding; therefore, it is not noncompetitive inhibition.\n\nStep 5: Analyzing irreversible inhibition\nIrreversible inhibition happens when the inhibitor binds irreversibly to the enzyme. Although DFP binds permanently, it does not mean it is irreversible inhibition because inhibition terminates when the substrate is added, and the enzyme regains its normal activity.\n\nStep 6: Analyzing partially competitive inhibition\nPartial inhibition implies that the inhibitor does not completely stop the function of the enzyme. However, since DFP permanently binds to the active site of ACE and renders it inactive, it cannot be considered a partial competitive inhibitor.\n\nAnswer: After analyzing each type of inhibition, we can conclude that the interaction between DFP and ACE best characterizes as (C) irreversible inhibition.",
