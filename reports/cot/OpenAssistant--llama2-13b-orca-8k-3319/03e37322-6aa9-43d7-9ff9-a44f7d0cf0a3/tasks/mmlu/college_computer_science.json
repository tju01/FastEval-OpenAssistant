In version 2, the file read (along with the underlying layout on disk) was modified to retrieve blocks of 4,000 bytes. The ratio of-the time required to read a large file under version 2 to the time required to read the same large file under version 1 is approximately\n\n(A) 1:4\n(B) 1:3.5\n(C) 1:1\n(D) 1.1:1",

            "model_answer": "Let's break down the given information and how it all relates to the disk transfer time, operating system overhead, and possible ratio differences between version 1 and 2:\n\n1. Disk Transfer Time: Under version 1, the disk transfer time is 1 msec per 1,000 bytes and under version 2, it's 1 msec per 4,000 bytes (4 blocks of 1,000 bytes each). \n\n2. Operating System Overhead: Under version 1, the operating system overhead is 1 msec per 1,000 bytes + 10 msec, so 11 msec. Under version 2, it would still be 1 msec per 1,000 bytes + 10 msec, but on a smaller chunk of bytes (1,000 bytes vs 4,000 bytes), so it would be 11 msec.\n\nNow, let's assign variables to represent each part like this:\nLet T = overall time required for a single file-read operation in version 2, and S = overall time required under version 1.\n\nSo now we can compute the disk transfer time under version 2 like this: T_2 = disk transfer time * 4,000 bytes (version 2 big blocks)/(1,000 bytes * 4,000 bytes) = 4 msec.\nNow, we have the overall time in version 1 as T_1 = disk transfer time * 1,000 bytes + operating system overhead = disk transfer time (1 msec per 1,000 bytes) + operating system overhead (11 msec). And the overall time in version 2 as T = disk transfer time * 4,000 bytes (version 2 big blocks) + operating system overhead = disk transfer time * 4,000 bytes + operating system overhead.\nSo we can now set up an equation to relate T_1 (time under version 1) to T (time under version 2): \n\nT = (T_1 - disk transfer time per version 1)(version 2 big blocks) + operating system overhead.\n\nNote that we trivially know what operating system overhead is for both versions: 11 msec under version 1 and 11 msec under version 2. Next, we need to express T_1 in terms of the disk transfer time in version 1. Since we already identified T_1, we can argue that since \"version 2 big blocks\"=(4,000 bytes)/(1,000 bytes) = 4, then \"disk transfer time per version 1\"=(1,000 bytes)/(4,000 bytes) = 1/4. So now, we can set up our equation:\n\nT = (T_1 - 1/4)(version 2 big blocks) + operating system overhead\n\nNow let's just divide both sides by disk transfer time in version 2, which is per 4,000 bytes:\nT_1 = T - (1/4)(version 2 big blocks) + operating system overhead/(4,000 bytes)\n\nNote that the operating system overhead is identical for both versions, so we can move it outside the parentheses:\nT_1 = T - (1/4)(version 2 big blocks) + 11/(4,000 bytes)\nNow, we can move the term onto the right side and divide both sides by 4,000 bytes:\nT_1 = T - (1/4)(version 2 big blocks) + 11/4,000 + (1/4)\n\nFactor out the term operating system overhead and using basic algebra, we reach this:\nT_1 = 1/2 * (1 - 1/4) * T_2 + 1/2 * operating system overhead\n\nNow form a ratio of the total time, when reading a large file under version 2 to version 1:\nRatio = (T_1/T_2) = (1/2 * (1 - 1/4) * T_2 + 1/2 * operating system overhead)/T_2) / (version 1 big blocks/version 2 big blocks)\n       = (1/2 * (1 - 1/4) * T_2 + 1/2 * operating system overhead)/(version 2 big blocks/version 1 big blocks)\n       = (version 2 big blocks * 1/2 * (1 - 1/4) * T_2 + 1/2 * operating system overhead)/(version 1 big blocks/(version 2 big blocks))\n       = (version 2 big blocks * 1/2 * (1 - 1/4) * T_2 + 1/2 * operating system overhead)/(version 1 big blocks)/(version 2 big blocks/version 1 big blocks)\n\nNow we can factor out the version 1 big blocks:\n        = (version 2 big blocks * 1/2 * (1 - 1/4) * T_2 + 1/2 * operating system overhead)\n   /(version 1 big blocks/(version 2 big blocks))\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction:\n        = version 2 big blocks * 1/2 * (1 - 1/4) * T_2 + 1/2 * operating system overhead\n        = version 2 big blocks * 1/2 * (1 - 1/4) * (T_2 - T_1) + 1/2 * operating system overhead\n        = 1/4 * (version 2 big blocks * 1/2 * (1 - 1/4) * (T_2 - T_1) + 1/2 * operating system overhead)\n\n(The last step uses the rule for multiplying a fraction a/b with a b/c, which is a/c.)\n\nSo, finally we have that if T_2 is version 2's greater time, then:\n     Ratio = (T_2 - T_1) = 1/4 * (version 2 big blocks * 1/2 * (1 - 1/4) * T_2 + 1/2 * operating system overhead)\n\nSo, the ratio of the time required to read a large file under version 2 to the time required to read the same large file under version 1 is approximately:\n\n(B) 1:3.5",

To form a boolean expression, we can use two basic operations: AND and NOT. For example, (TRUE AND FALSE) is FALSE, as FALSE is considered as NOT TRUE in AND logic. Similarly we can use NOT as well, for example, NOT(TRUE AND NOT TRUE) = TRUE. Thus, (A) {AND, NOT} can be used to form all kinds of Boolean Expressions correctly.\n\n2.

So, by simply combining NOT with OR, we can form all boolean expressions except those which ignore an OR operation.\n\n3. {AND, OR}: Now, when we combine AND and OR, we can perform operations using the following truth table:\n\nA | B | AND | OR \ni | x | i | 1\nx | i | x | 1\n\nSince it creates meaningful expressions, this set {AND, OR} is also a complete set of Boolean operators.\n\n4. **{NAND}: **NAND does NOT form a complete set of Boolean operators.
