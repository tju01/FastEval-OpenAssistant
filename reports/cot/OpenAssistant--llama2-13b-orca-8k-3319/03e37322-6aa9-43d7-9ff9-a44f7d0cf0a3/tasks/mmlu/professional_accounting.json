            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Calculate the daily revenue\nThe limousine will be rented for $245 per hour. 2 hours a day on average will generate a daily income of 245 x 2 = $490.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the daily expense\nEstimate a daily expense of $50 for the limousine to be hired.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the daily income after accounting for the daily expense\nTaking daily expense into account, the limousine would still have an income of 490 - 50 = $440 per day.\n\nStep 4: Calculate weekly income without considering holidays or festive days\nAs the limousine will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, it works for about 365 days a year (not including weekends or holidays). So, there are about 365/2 = 182.5 days available for rental. At an average income of $440 per day, the annual income would be 182.5 days * $440 = $79,720.\n\nSo, the estimated yearly yield on your investment is: (B) 1.64%.",

Find the present value of the bond (face value minus coupons):\n   The bond pays coupons of 5% each year, so there are 3 coupons of 5% each. \n   The present value of the coupons can be calculated as follows:\n   PV of coupons = (Coupon_amount/Bond_value) * Remaining_years\n   PV of coupons, mathematically: (5%/yr) * (3 years / 100% * 3 years * 100%) + (5%/yr) * (2 years / 100% * 2 years * 100%) + (5%/yr) * (1 year / 100% * 1 year * 100%)\n\n2. Calculate the present value of the bond:\n   PV calculated so far: (5%/yr) * (1 year / 100% * 1 year * 100%) + (5%/yr) * (2 years / 100% * 2 years * 100%)\n\n3. Find the yield-to-maturity of the bond:\n   Yield-to-maturity = 6% / (1 + YTM)\u00b3 / 100\n\n4.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this multiple-choice question, let's go through the options one by one and analyze them.\n\n(A) It will be reclassified as an asset held for sale.\nReason: Since the company expects to complete the sale in four months, they will most likely reclassify it as an asset held for sale. This makes sense because they are trying to sell it.\n\n(B) It will be classified as a current asset.\nReason: Current assets refer to those that are expected to be converted into cash within one year. The sale of the building in four months indicates that it will be a current asset due to the short duration of time until the sale occurs.\n\n(C) It will no longer be depreciated.\nReason: When a long-term asset is classified as held for sale, or when its sale is expected within one year, accounting standards allow it to be measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. This means that its depreciation is likely reduced or discontinued depending on the fair value. Without further information, it cannot be confirmed.\n\n(D) It will be valued at historical cost.\nReason: If the building is not a current asset, its value would not be recorded according to historical cost in the books. As mentioned in (C), if it is reclassified as held for sale or its sale is expected within the coming year, its value would be measured based on the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, which doesn't necessarily mean historical cost.\n\nOutput the answer: The correct statement is (B) It will be classified as a current asset.",

            "question": "Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock of a C corporation.

Carson accurately reported $28,000 in gross income on Carson\u2019s individual tax return. If the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions to the owners had been proportionate, how much income would Carson have reported on Carson\u2019s individual return?\n\n(A) $28,000\n(B) $132,000\n(C) $160,000\n(D) $188,000",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To find the correct answer, let's walk through the income reporting for a C corporation versus an S corporation.\n\nFor a C corporation, the corporation pays taxes on its taxable income, and shareholders pay taxes on their dividends. In this case, Carson accurately reported $28,000 in gross income on an individual tax return, which includes his share of the dividends.\n\nNow, let's consider the hypothetical scenario where the corporation was an S corporation, and distributions to the owners were proportionate. In an S corporation, all income of the corporation is taxed at the shareholder level and passed through to the owners' individual tax returns as dividends. Since the distributions are proportional to the ownership percentage, Carson would have reported his proportional share of the taxable income:\n\n- If the corporation reported $400,000 in taxable income:\n  1. Divide the total taxable income by the number of shareholders (1 in the scenario, but for multiple shareholders, it would be divided): $400,000 / 1 = $400,000\n  2. Multiply the total taxable income by Carson's ownership percentage: $400,000 * 40% = $160,000\n  3. In addition to the taxable income, Carson might receive a proportionate share of dividends. If the corporation distributed a total of $70,000 in cash dividends, divide the amount by the total number of outstanding shares (again, imagine multiple shareholders in this scenario): $70,000 / 1 = $70,000\n  4. Multiply the proportionate share of dividends by Carson's ownership percentage: $70,000 * 40% = $28,000\n\nSo, the answer is: If the corporation had been an S corporation, Carson would have reported $160,000 in gross income on his individual tax return.\n\n(C) $160,000",
