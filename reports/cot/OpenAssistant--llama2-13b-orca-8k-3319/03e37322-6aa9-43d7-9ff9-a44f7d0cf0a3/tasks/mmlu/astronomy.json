            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's go through each answer choice and analyze the information.\n\n(A) This type occurs in binary systems: Binary systems are two stars orbiting around a shared center of mass. While type-Ia supernovae are associated with a binary system, it is not the sole cause of type-Ia supernovae.\n\n(B) This type occurs in young galaxies: This is incorrect, as type-Ia supernovae are not exclusive to young galaxies. In fact, they can occur in both old and young galaxies, although they are more common in galaxies with old populations of stars.\n\n(C) This type produces gamma-ray bursts: Type-Ia supernovae, also known as \"standard candles,\" have an important role in astronomy. However, they do not produce gamma-ray bursts.\n\n(D) This type produces high amounts of X-rays: Type-Ia supernovae emit X-rays during the explosion, though they are typically less intense than other types of supernovae.\n\nBased on our reasoning, the correct answer is B) This type occurs in young galaxies.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option one by one:\n\n(A) Its speed relative to you: \nThis option is unrelated to the information given that you know the actual brightness and apparent brightness. The object's speed is not given any information in this scenario, so it cannot be deduced without additional information.\n\n(B) Its composition: \nThis option also deals with the composition or material of the object. However, no information about the object's composition is given in this scenario. Thus, its composition cannot be estimated without additional information.\n\n(C) Its size: \nThe apparent brightness solely relies on the object's area that is visible from your location. If an object is closer to you, the apparent brightness is higher, even if it has the same surface area. As a result, the apparent brightness can only determine the object's distance, not its size (area).\n\n(D) Its distance from you:\nThis option considers the relationship between the object's apparent brightness and its distance relative to you. The apparent brightness decreases with increasing distance, while the actual brightness does not change, hence object's distance can be determined if the actual and apparent brightness are known.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) Its distance from you.",

            "question": "Why is the sky blue?\n\n(A) Because the molecules that compose the Earth's atmosphere have a blue-ish color.\n(B) Because the sky reflects the color of the Earth's oceans.\n(C) Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.\n(D) Because the Earth's atmosphere preferentially absorbs all other colors.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Answer: (C) Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.\n\nExplanation: The reason the sky appears blue is because of the atmosphere's ability to scatter sunlight rays. Sunlight contains a wide spectrum of colors, but when it interacts with the atmosphere, blue light is scattered more efficiently than other colors due to the particular wavelengths it has. Because blue light is scattered more easily than other colors, it is the color we notice when looking at the sky. While rays of sunlight are entering the atmosphere, they pass through different layers, within which various molecules and particles scatter the light. This scattering of the light pollutes the direct light, so what we see is not pure sunlight, but light that has been diffused by passing through the atmosphere. Blue light is more readily scattered because its wavelengths are shorter and the particles in the atmosphere are more efficiently able to scatter that light. As a result, when you look up at the sky, the visual perception of blue dominates the other colors of the spectrum. \n\nTherefore, the statement (C) is correct in its explanation of why the sky appears blue. The other options are not accurate. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because the atmosphere's molecules do not have a specific color, instead the scattering causes the incoherent sum of all colors in sunlight to give the appearance of blue. \n\nOption (B) is incorrect because reflection of ocean color is not a primary cause of the skyblue appearance. The ocean only plays a role if there is a direct view of the horizon, and even then it is a contribution to the scattered light, not the primary cause of the pale blue shade of the sky.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because though the atmosphere does preferentially absorb some wavelengths of light, it\u2019s mainly the scattering that creates the sky\u2019s appearance and not absorption.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, let's break down the problem step-by-step. The comet, m, will impact the Earth, M, at a certain speed, v. Total energy released due to the impact will be the kinetic energy (1/2 * m * v^2) and potential energy (R * m * G * M / R^2). We want to find the expression for this energy, so let's factor it out.\n\nThe total energy released is: E = 1/2 * m * v^2 (kinetic energy) + R * m * G * M / R^2 (potential energy)\n\nNow, we can combine the two parts of the total energy:\n\nE = (1/2 * m * v^2) + R * m * G * M / R^2\n\nNow, let's expand the equation:\n\nE = (1/2) * m * v^2 + R * m * G * M / R^2\n\nSubtract m * v^2 / 2 from both sides of the equation:\n\nE - (1/2) * m * v^2 = R * m * G * M / R^2\n\nDistribute m in the term with v^2:\n\n(E - (1/2) * m * v^2) = R * m * G * M / R^2\n\nNow, replace R * m * G * M / R^2 with (R * m * G * M) / R^2:\n\n(E - (1/2) * m * v^2) = (R * m * G * M) / R^2\n\nAssuming R is a constant here, cancel out R's from both sides of the equation:\n\n(E - (1/2) * m * v^2) = (m * G * M)\n\nNext, let's rearrange the equation to make E the subject:\n\nE = (1/2) * m * v^2 + (m * G * M)\n\nThe problem now seems to have the same form as the given options, but none of them are accounting only for the kinetic energy. Option (A) seems to be missing the term involving v^2, and option (D) is missing the term involving G and M. However, option (D) is closer because it accounts for gravitational force. Thus, the correct expression for the total energy released in the impact is:\n\nC) 0.5 * m * (2 * G * M) / R = 0.5 * m * (2 * G * M) / R",
