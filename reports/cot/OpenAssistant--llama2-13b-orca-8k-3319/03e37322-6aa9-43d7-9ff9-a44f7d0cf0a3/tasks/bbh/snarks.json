Sarcastic statements are usually made to emphasize or express a total opposite, which is what we need to identify in these two statements.\n\nNow let's analyze the statements:\n\n(A) Have you tried not being poor? It is much easier\n(B) Have you tried not being rude? It is much easier\n\nSarcasm usually involves words with opposite meanings and an element of critique or mockery. Let's assess these statements one by one:\n\n(A) Suggesting not being poor is easier implies that poverty is an easy or trivial issue, which indirectly implies that it's not a serious challenge. This statement seems to mock or exaggerate the situation, indicating sarcasm.\n\n(B) Asking if someone's tried not being rude also implies mockery or an opposite statement, as rudeness is generally frowned upon and not seen as easy or trivial to avoid. This statement also seems sarcastic.\n\nAs we looked at both statements, we can conclude that both are sarcastic. So the final answer is (A) for \"Have you tried not being poor?

This statement is sarcastic because suggesting that we replace trams with carriages is not a practical or logical idea.\n\n(B) Yeah.

This is often meant to be humorous, or to highlight the irony in a situation.\n\nThe meaning behind option (B) \"Yeah, I've noticed he's been exercising every day recently, what a great transformation\" is clear and straightforward, therefore it is not sarcastic.

The reason behind this hypothesis is that most sarcastic comments involve a contrast between two opposite undesirable facts or situations.\n\nNow let's analyze the statement:\n\n(1) It's noting a positive aspect (\"Good thing\") in a situation where you might expect to say something negative or sardonic.\n(2) The statement is relevant to the speed of price increase, referring to the time span of \"eight years ago,\" which is a fairly significant amount of time. This fact makes the statement more true compared to the previous day when the difference might have been insignificant.\n\nAfter analyzing, we can now conclude that the statement is sarcastic because it is an ironic way of remarking on a situation... \n\nAnswer (A) Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight years ago.",

Trolls, however, are not a species. They are derogatory and not commonly considered endangered. The statement uses sarcastic wit, as it's uncommon to be thanked for feeding something that doesn't exist as a species.\n\nAfter analyzing both options, we can conclude that option (A) is sarcasm as it implies the phrase has been misused.\n\nAnswer: (A)",
