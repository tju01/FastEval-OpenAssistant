This means removing:\n\ntotal black items = 2 black chargers + 0 (there are no black items currently on the table for a new addition) = 2 black items\n\nWhen we remove 2 black items from the table, we will have:\n\npink chargers remaining = 3 (original pink chargers) - 2 (black items removed) = 1 (pink charger remains)\n\nNow, let us calculate the total scrunchiephone chargers (that will be left on the table after removing black items):\n\nTotal scrunchiephone chargers remaining = 1 (pink charger)\nTotal remaining scrunchiephone chargers = 1 - 2 (black chargers removed) = 0\n\nHowever, there is still a pink charger remaining on the table.
