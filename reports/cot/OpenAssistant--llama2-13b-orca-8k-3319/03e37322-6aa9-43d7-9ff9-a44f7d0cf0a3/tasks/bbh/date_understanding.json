            "model_answer": "First, let's count the number of days between March 20, 2020, and today's date, considering that 176 days have already passed.\n\nSince it's currently not specified what day today is, let's assume it's October 29, 2020. In October, there are 29 days -- with 176 - 29 = 147 remaining days in 2020.\n\nAdditionally, we know that one year has 365 days in a common year and 366 days in a leap year. Since 2020 is not a leap year, there are 365 days remaining in the year after October 29, 2020.\n\nIn short, we can calculate the number of days remaining in 2020 as 147 + 365 = 512 days.\n\nNow, we need to find the date 365 days from March 20, 2020. This is done by adding 365 days to March 20, 2020:\n\nMarch 20 + 365 = March 21, 2021.\n\nTo determine the day after tomorrow (i.e., September 14, 2020), we need to add another 365 (for the first day) + 2 (from September 2021 to October 2021) = 367 days:\n\nMarch 21 + 367 = September 21, 2021.  \n\nNow the answer:\n(C) 09/13/2057",

            "model_answer": "To find the date 10 days ago from Jan 21, 2011, we first need to identify the day of the week for the given date. We will do this by calculating the date difference and adding the difference to the current date.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the day of the week on Jan 21, 2011.\nSince it is a specific date, we can just refer to resources, like this website: https://www.timeanddate.com/date/dateadd.html\n\nJanuary 21, 2011, fell on a Friday. (So you are right in your answer)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the difference to make it 10 days ago.\nUsing our rules of subtraction with dates, we know that when you move forward by 10 days, we subtract 10 from the number of days and add 10 to the number of the month.\n\nNext, since days and months are being added and subtracted separately, align the increments together in the same direction with a common denominator.\n\nThe formula for subtracting 10 days is 2011 - 10 = 2111, and as we know, this changes to 1111 once the month is added in, because a period of 400 years is a leap year (in this case, 2110 had extra days since it was divisible by 4).\n\nTherefore, 2111 - 1111 (which is equal to 2120) equals 1011 months. \n\nNow, the date needs to be moved forward 1011 months. (That was a long sentence). The full second part of the formula is: 2111 + 1011 = 3222. This means we will be subtracting the last two digits instead of adding them on the given date because we are subtracting years, which already contains the month increment.\n\nSo 3222 from 2111 equals 1111. Now, we get \n\nJanuary 14, 3222!\n\nStep 3: Output the answer.\nNow let us convert the date found into the DD/MM/YYYY format.\n\nJanuary 14th, 3222 = 14/01/3222\n\nSo the date 10 days ago from Jan 21, 2011 is 14/01/3222\n\n(F) 08/12/2010",
