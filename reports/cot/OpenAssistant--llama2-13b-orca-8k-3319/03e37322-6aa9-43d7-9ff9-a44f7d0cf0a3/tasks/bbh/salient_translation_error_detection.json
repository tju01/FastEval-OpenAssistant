The modifier \"also known as\" is correctly translated, but the terms \"Chilly Mob\" and \"Philadelphia-South Jersey Mafia\" are introduced as alternative names for the Bruno family. This is an error, as the term \"Philly Mob,\" which is the other translation offered, is a more accurate representation of the family's name than \"Chilly Mob.\" Dropping \"Chilly\" from the translation removes relevant information about the family, which is an error, so the mistake belongs to the category of \"Modifiers or Adjectives.\"",
