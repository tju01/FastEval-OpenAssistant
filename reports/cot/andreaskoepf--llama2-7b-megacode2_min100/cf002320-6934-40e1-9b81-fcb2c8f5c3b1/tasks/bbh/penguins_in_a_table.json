We now add a penguin to the table:\nJames, 12, 90, 12\nAnd here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:\nname, age, height (cm), weight (kg)\nJody, 5, 430, 620\nGladys, 10, 420, 590\nMarian, 2, 310, 410\nDonna, 9, 440, 650\nWhat is the name of the last giraffe?\nOptions:\n(A) Jody\n(B) Gladys\n(C) Marian\n(D) Donna\n(E) Louise",

            "model_answer": "To find the name of the last giraffe, we first need to identify the table with penguins and giraffes. This seems to be the first table in the given information:\n\n| name             | age   | height (cm) | weight (kg) |\n|-------------------|--------|------------|------------|\n| Louis            | 7     | 50        | 11        |\n| Bernard          | 5     | 80        | 13        |\n| Vincent          | 9     | 60        | 11        |\n| Gwen            | 8     | 70        | 15        |\n\nNow, we see that this table lists penguins, so there is no last giraffe. Since the last line we have is a data point for James:\n\n| name             | age   | height (cm) | weight (kg) |\n|-------------------|--------|------------|------------|\n| Louis            | 7     | 50        | 11        |\n| Bernard          | 5     | 80        | 13        |\n| Vincent          | 9     | 60        | 11        |\n| Gwen            | 8     | 70        | 15        |\n| James            | 12    | 90        | 12        |\n\nWe know there are 5 giraffes and 4 penguins in the table above.
