So, the second object from the left should be the second to the right or the leftmost.

Thus, this option doesn't match the paragraph.\n\n(C) \"The red book is the second from the left.\"\nSince the paragraph specifies that there are only three books on the shelf, and the orange book is the leftmost and there can only be one leftmost book, we can deduce that the leftmost book is not the red book.
