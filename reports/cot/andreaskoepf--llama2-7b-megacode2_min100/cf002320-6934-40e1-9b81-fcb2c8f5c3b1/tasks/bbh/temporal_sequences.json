In this case, we would consider this option.\n\n3. Anthony saw James before Sean: Anthony saw him from 7am to 3pm and Sean saw him from 5am to 6am. This means that between Anthony and Sean, James was either sleeping or somewhere they were not aware of during their respective times of observation. In this case, considering Anthony's end time (3pm), it's more likely Anthony saw James just before the entire beach was closed.\n\n4. William saw James before Sean: William saw him from 4pm to 9pm.

Therefore, she could not have gone to the startup before 7:45am at the earliest.\n\n(3) Betty saw her driving to the water park from 2pm to 3pm.

We can eliminate those times since the classroom was closed after 8pm.\n\nSo, now we have two opportunities left: between 7am to 10am and between 11am to 2pm.\n\nStep 3: Assess which window of time is most likely\nThe window from 7am to 10am would mean Richard would be at the classroom before David sees him reading at the library. It seems less likely. On the other hand, the window from 11am to 2pm could be a possibility since he would be free from the rooftop first and then go to the classroom.\n\nBased on the information available, it is most probable that Richard went to the physics classroom between 11am to 2pm.\n\nAnswer: (C) 11am to 2pm",

Determine if there is any overlap in those times.\n3. Choose the time range with no overlap.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) 8am to 10am: The art studio was closed then.\n(B) 2pm to 3pm: Andrew was at the electronics store.\n(C) 4pm to 6pm: Andrew was buying lunch at the deli.\n(D) 3pm to 4pm: Andrew was at the library.\n\nSince we know that the art studio was closed after 6pm, we can eliminate option (A). From the remaining options, we need to determine if there's any overlap in the given times.\n\n- Option (B): Andrew was at the electronics store from 8am to 10am, which is not an overlap with any other times.\n- Option (C): Andrew was buying lunch at the deli from 4pm to 6pm.\n- Option (D): Andrew was at the library from 3pm to 4pm.\n\nThere is an overlap between option C and D, since 4pm is in common between the time Andrew was at the library and time he was buying lunch at the deli. Therefore, Andrew could not have gone to the art studio between 4pm and 6pm.\n\nNow we're left with only one option:\n\n(B) 2pm to 3pm: Between these two options, this time range doesn't have any overlap with the other given times.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.",

We know Sean goes to school from 11am to 2pm, watches a movie at 5am to 6am, works out at the gym at 7am to 9am, and buys cookies at a bakery at 6am to 7am. Therefore, Sean can't go to the basketball court during these times.\n\nNow, let's find the time periods during which the basketball court is open for Sean:\n\n2. The basketball court is not open between 5am and 6am, 6am to 7am, from 7am to 9am, and from 11am to 4pm because it is closed during these times.\n\n3.
