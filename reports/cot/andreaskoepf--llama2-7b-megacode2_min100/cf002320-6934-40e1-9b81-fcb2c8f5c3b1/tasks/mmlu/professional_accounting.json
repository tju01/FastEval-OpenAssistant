However, the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory. \n\nThe question then asks what effect the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise had on Arno's balance sheet at year end. We must analyze the effect concerning the asset and liability categories on the balance sheet.\n\nStep 1: Identify if there was a credit purchase made or not\nSince the purchase was not recorded as a credit purchase, it would not appear on the balance sheet. Therefore, there is no credit purchase to consider.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the effect on assets\nThe merchandise is included in the year-end physical inventory, so it must have an effect on the assets.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the effect on the inventory balance\nThe year-end physical inventory would reflect the balance of merchandise, but the actual cost at the time of acquisition may differ. This difference results from purchase discounts or additional purchases made during the reporting period. Thus, the balance of merchandise included in the physical inventory may understate the actual value.\n\nConclusion: As the question asks about the effect on the balance sheet only, the answer should reflect the possible partial or complete understatement of assets due to the missing credit purchase information.\n\nThe final line answering the question should be: (D) Understated Understated",

Analyze the given statements:\nStatement A: Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\nStatement B: Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.\nStatement C: Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.\nStatement D: Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.\n\n2. Identify the statement that refers to audit sampling risks and relates to a nonissuer.\nOption A and C talk about nonsampling risk, where A is related to a sample, and C is about uncertainty in applying audit procedures. It's difficult to derive a clear conclusion about which of these might specifically pertain to a nonissuer without additional context.\nStatement B and D are both about nonsampling risks, with B referring to auditors failing to recognize misstatements and D about selecting appropriate audit procedures.\n\n3. Since none of the options provided clearly link to nonissuer risks, we'll assume they are all valid options.\n\n4. Now, let's consider all four options in the context of nonissuer risks:\n  A could apply to a nonissuer if they sells their own products, but the risk refers to the results of substantive tests being different.\n  B might not apply to nonissuer risks as they are about auditors missing misstatements, which are internal control risks.\n  C is relevant to audit sample uncertainties, which could apply as nonissuers may not provide enough information or poor quality accounting.\n  D may also apply to nonissuers since they could have specific objectives that need to be met by choosing audit procedures.\n\n5. After considering all the options and their relation to nonissuers, the most relevant statement is:\n\n(D) Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.\n\nSince this answer is the most relevant to nonissuers, the final line should contain the answer as a single letter: D",

            "model_answer": "Auditors generally perform a comprehensive review and examination of a company's financial statements while following Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). One of the crucial steps in this process is to examine and highlight any subsequent events that might have a material impact on the financial statements. Subsequent events are those that have occurred after the period covered by the financial statements but before the auditor issues their report.\n\nThere are four commonly accepted procedures:\n\n1. Reviewing events after the financial statements are issued (post-issuance events).\n2. Inspecting inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end.\n3. Testing internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate.\n4. Reviewing the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.\n\n(D) Comparing the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited is another essential step taken by auditors to ensure the correctness and completeness of financial statements provided by the company. The auditors need to compare the interim financial statements with the final (audited) statements to identify any inconsistencies or differences.\n\nIn the context given, the following procedures can be selected based on their relevance and materiality:\n\n- Reviewing events after the financial statements are issued (post-issuance events) - This procedure is generally employed to ensure nothing significant has occurred after the audit process has concluded, as it can impact the overall financial audit report.\n- Comparing the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited - This procedure is employed to help verify the financial statements during the audit process.\n\nSince both procedures are linked to the overall audit process, it can be concluded that auditors generally perform both (D) Comparing the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited and some forms of (A) Reviewing events after the financial statements are issued (post-issuance events). However, the specific arrangement of these procedures will depend on the client's industry, the materiality of the events, and the auditor's judgment.\n\nThus, the answer would be:\n\n(A) Inspect inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end and (D) Comparing the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited would be the most common methods undertaken by auditors to address and account for subsequent events related to financial statement audits.",

To calculate bother, we can use the formula:\n\nBother = (Face Value * YTM) / (Market Price)\n\nNow, let's plug in the values into our YTM formula:\n\nYTM = (5% / (1 - bother)) - 1\nYTM = (5 / 95) - 1\n\nNext, we need to solve for bother by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n1 - bother = ((5 * 95) - 1) / 5\nbother = (475 - 1) / 5\nbother = 474 / 5\nbother = 94.8\n\nNow that we know bother, we can calculate the market price (B):\n\nB = (Face Value * YTM / (1 - Bother))\nB = ($100 * 6% / (1 - 94.8))\nB = ($100 * 6 % / (1 - 0.948))\nB = ($100 * 6% / 0.052)\nB = $1922.40\n\nThe market price of the bond is $1922.40 ($100 * 6% / 0.052). Now, we have all the necessary information to determine the bond's yield (Bother) when held to maturity:\n\nYield to maturity (Notice we are using the bond's face value, so it's a \"0-coupon bond\", meaning it doesn't pay any coupon payments):\nYTM = 0.06 - 1(YTM)\nYTM = (0.06 - 1)\nYTM = -0.04\n\nYield to maturity (Bother = 0, so now it's a \"0-coupon bond\"):\nYTD(Bother = 0) = Coupon % / (Market Price + Face Value)\n0.06 / (1.0924 + 100)\n0.06 / 110.24\n0.0904\n\nFinally, let's find the current bond price:\n\nPurchase Price = (Face value * YTD* Expiration actually occurs on this date)\nPurchase Price = ($100 * 0.0904 * 12)\nPurchase Price = $97.33\n\nTherefore, the price of a three-year bond is $97.33.",

The corporation reported $400,000 in taxable income. To find how much income Carson received, we multiply the corporation's income by Carson's ownership percentage:\n40% * $400,000 = $160,000\n\nStep 2: Determine the amount of taxes the corporation paid.\nThe corporation paid $160,000 in taxes. To find how much Carson paid, we subtract the corporation's taxes from Carson's share of income:\n$160,000 (Carson's share) - $160,000 (corporation's taxes) = 0 (no taxes paid)\n\nStep 3: Determine the amount of dividends Carson received.\nThe corporation distributed $70,000 in cash dividends to its shareholders. To find how much Carson received, we subtract the corporation's taxes from their share of income:\n$160,000 (Carson's share) - $160,000 (corporation's taxes) = $0\n$0 (Carson's share after taxes) + $70,000 (dividends) = $70,000\n\nStep 4: Add Carson's gross income from the corporation's dividends to their individual income.\nUsing the formula:\n$28,000 (individual income) + $70,000 (corporate dividends) = $98,000 (total income)\n\nStep 5: Calculate the taxable income for Carson.\nThe corporation's taxes were $0 because it was a C corporation, so its taxable income is the same as the individual income:\n$98,000 (total income) = $98,000 (taxable income)\n\nStep 6: Relate the individual tax rate to the corporate tax rate.\nAssuming both Carson and the corporation are in the same tax bracket, the individual tax rate in this case would be equal to the corporate tax rate:\nCarson's tax bracket = Corporate tax bracket\n\nStep 7: Calculate Carson's tax liability.\nUsing the formula:\n$98,000 (taxable income) * (Corporate tax rate) = $19,792 (Carson's tax liability)\n\nNow that we have determined Carson's tax liability, we can calculate their total tax on the individual return by multiplying their individual income by the tax rate:\n$28,000 (individual income) * (individual tax rate) = $28,000 * (5%) = $1,400\n\nStep 8: Finally, subtract the tax liabilities from the total income to find the amount of money Carson would receive during a tax year as an S corporation.\nSince the distributions to the owners in an S corporation would be proportionate, we can take Carson's total individual income for a tax year and subtract their individual tax liability:\n$28,000 (individual income) - $1,400 (total tax liability) = $26,600\n\nNow we've calculated the total amount of money Carson would have received as an S corporation without the corporation having to pay taxes.
