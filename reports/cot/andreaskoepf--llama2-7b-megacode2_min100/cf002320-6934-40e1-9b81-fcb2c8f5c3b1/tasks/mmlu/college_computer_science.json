            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's evaluate each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) The matrix, if stored directly, is large and can be clumsy to manage - There is a possibility that a large matrix might be difficult to manage, but it is a separate issue than the capability of expressing protection requirements.\n\n(B) It is not capable of expressing complex protection requirements - This option is irrelevant to the issue of managing access to resources or protection itself. The access matrix can be used to define complex protection requirements.\n\n(C) Deciding whether a process has access to a resource is undecidable - The fact that the decision is \"undecidable\" implies that it is impossible to know for certain whether a process has access to a resource. However, the access matrix approach is capable of expressing the possible access levels of a process to different resources.\n\n(D) There is no way to express who has rights to change the access matrix itself - This option can be a limitation of an access matrix, but it does not stop the access matrix from being able to express rights for changing the access matrix.\n\nAfter evaluating each option, the final answer is that the greatly simplifies access controls can be undecidable in some cases. Also, the matrix can be difficult to manage due to its large size. However, the answer does not directly relate to whether the approach can express complex protection requirements or rights to change the access matrix.",

For disk transfer time:\n\n1000 * 10.1 msec (version 2)/(1000 * 9 msec (version 1)) = 2.12 msec per 1,000 bytes\n\nNow, we compare the two average read transfer times in version 1 and version 2:\n\n(2.12 msec per 1,000 bytes in version 2) x (1,000) = 2,120 msec\n(9 msec per 1,000 bytes in version 1) x (1,000) = 9,000 msec\n\nSince we're looking for the ratio of the time required in version 2:\n\n2,120 msec (version 2) / 9,000 msec (version 1) = 0.23\n\nSo, the ratio of the time required to read a large file under version 2 to the time required to read the same large file under version 1 is approximately:\n\n(A) 1:4",
