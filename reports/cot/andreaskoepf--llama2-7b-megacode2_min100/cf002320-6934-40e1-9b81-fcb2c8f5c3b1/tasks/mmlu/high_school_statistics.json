The means of these samples should be approximately equal to each other and to the population mean (300 milligrams). It's a one-sided hypothesis test since we don't know if the sample means are above or below the population mean.\n\n2. Calculate t-score (two-tailed): The formula for t-score is (sample mean - population mean) / standard deviation.\n\n   Sample mean = average weight of 7 tablets = (299 + 300 + 305 + 302 + 299 + 301 + 303) / 7 = 301.333\n\n   Population mean = 300 milligrams\n\n   Standard deviation = standard deviation of the population is unknown. For simplicity, we could use a high but reasonable estimate, such as 10 milligrams.\n\n   t-score = (301.333 - 300) / 10 = 1.333 (approximately)\n\n3. Calculate p-value: The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic (t-score) as large or larger when the null hypothesis (population mean is equal to the sample mean) is true. We use the signed rate of the t-distribution with df = 7 degrees of freedom.\n\n   P(t > 1.54) with df = 7 = 0.05 (approximately)\n\n4. Answer: The P-value of the test is 0.05.",

Higher statistical power allows them to better detect differences between the null and alternative hypotheses.\n\nStep 4: Determine the impact of the modification\nWith more experimental units, the researchers will have a better ability to detect differences between the null and alternative hypotheses.

Next, let's find how many standard deviations the height difference is from the mean height for each sex.\n3. According to the problem, the standard deviation of heights for adult men is 4 inches.

The df indicates the number of degrees of freedom. Different df values will affect the shape and standard deviation of the t-distribution. So this statement is true.\n\n(B) t-distributions are bell-shaped and symmetric.\nReasoning: Just like all bell-shaped distributions must have the same shape (except for the mirror reflection), all symmetric distributions also have the property that the median is at the midpoint of the distribution. Since t-distributions are used to model non-normal distributions with approximately normal-like shapes, they should have some bell-shaped property.\n\n(C) t-distributions always have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\nReasoning: The mean of a t-distribution cannot be 0 because its infinity value is 1. The standard deviation, however, is indeed 1 as t-distributions are located in a hyperbolic region around the mean. \n\n(D) t-distributions are more spread out than the normal distribution.\nReasoning: Normal distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, and the area under it is 1. As t-distributions are more spread out around the mean than a normal distribution, the t-distribution will have a larger area under it in some cases, and a smaller area in others.
