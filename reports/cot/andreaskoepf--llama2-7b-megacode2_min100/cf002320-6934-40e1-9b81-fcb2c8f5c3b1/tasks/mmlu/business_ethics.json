            "question": "_______ such as bitcoin are becoming increasingly mainstream and have a whole host of associated ethical implications, for example, they are______ and more ______. However, they have also been used to engage in _______.\n\n(A) Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime\n(B) Traditional currency, Cheap, Unsecure, Charitable giving\n(C) Cryptocurrencies, Cheap, Secure, Financial crime\n(D) Traditional currency, Expensive, Unsecure, Charitable giving",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(A) Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime\n(B) Traditional currency, Cheap, Unsecure, Charitable giving\nThe correct answer is (A) and (B).\n\nReasoning:\n1. The sentence mentions that bitcoin is becoming increasingly mainstream, which implies it is talked about in common conversations.\n2. The phrases associated with bitcoin are \"expensive\"; this suggests that bitcoin is not cheap.\n3. The words \"secure\" and \"financial crime\" are mentioned. This implies a strong connection to bitcoin.\n4. Financial crime is mentioned with \"more secure\" which might imply that bitcoin could to some extent be a shield from financial crime.\n5. The sentence also mentions tradional currency (specifically, \"expensive\").\n6. The words \"charitable giving\" are mentioned with \"cheap\"; however, they are paired with \"traditional currency,\" not bitcoin.\n\nSo, based on these points, the correct answers for bitcoin ethical implications are (A) Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime and (B) Expensive, Cheap, Unsecure, Charitable giving.\n\nAs for the other answer choices, they don't have this same strong connection to ethical implications associated with bitcoin.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The question is asking about the obligations of workers towards their employer, which can be classified as a specific set of rules or requirements that workers are bound to follow during the course of their employment. To answer this question, we need to analyze each option and compare it against the given context. So, let's go step-by-step:\n\n(A) Employee rights: These are the obligations of an employer towards their workers. They are the rights and entitlements that employees have that are protected by law. \n\n(B) Employee rights: This option is repeated. As mentioned earlier, I repeated the previous response as it.\n\n(C) Employer duties: As per the given context, the question is about the obligations of workers towards their employer. This term focuses on the responsibilities of employers.\n\n(D) Employee duties: This term is also about worker obligations, however, it refers to what workers are required to do for their employer and not what employers are required to do for their workers.\n\nComparing the obligations of workers towards their employer with the available options, we can see that employee rights and employer duties are about protection and requirements related to both parties - employer and employee. Employee rights are entitlements and benefits that are given to workers. In contrast, employer duties refer to the obligations that employers have in terms of responsibilities towards their workers.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context and the analysis of each option, the correct answer is (D) Employee duties. \n\nThe final line contains the answer as a single letter with parenthesis without anything else: (D)",

            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, I will analyze each option step-by-step:\n\nA) Presenteeism - This term refers to an employee's habit of coming to work while sick or unwell, but it would not typically refer to their preferred ratio of work-related and non-work-related activities.\n\nB) Absenteeism - This term refers to an employee's absence from work, which could be related to the underlying issue of work-life balance, but it is not specifically about the preference of work-related to non-work-related activities.\n\nC) Work-play balance - This term denotes a desired balance between work and play or other leisure activities that many employees might seek. This concept is related to the given question; however, it does not specifically address the preference of work-related activities.\n\nD) Work-life balance - This term refers to the ideal harmony between a person's work and personal life. It could be the preference of an employee in terms of the amount of time they would like to spend on work-related activities.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the closest answer to the question is (D) Work-life balance, as it addresses the preferences of employees in terms of work-related and non-work-related activities.",

It is also not describing ecological ecosystems, which refer to larger, natural systems involving the interaction of organisms. Instead, the sentence is referring to corporate ecosystems, which involve human-made organizations and their connections to the environment. Hence, the answer is:\n\n(D) Corporate ecosystems",

While power imbalance and informational asymmetries can be risks in general, they are not specific to collaborations between businesses and CSOs. Therefore, they don't answer the question directly.\n\nHowever, 'unfair distribution of resources' and 'unfair distribution of benefits' can be seen as limitations and risks specifically tied to business-CSO collaborations. In some instances, one party might have more resources or processed information, which can cause an imbalance in the relationship, with the party with fewer resources or information being at a disadvantage.\n\nAnswer: D",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Corporate profit maximization is an approach that aims to maximize financial gain for a company. Meanwhile, normative theories refer to the principles governing moral behavior and decision-making. \n\n(A) Hedonistic utilitarianism is a normative theory founded on the belief that the purpose of life is the maximization of pleasure and the minimization of pain for all sentient beings. While this theory may argue that large corporations should pursue profit maximization to meet the preferences of their shareholders (potentially leading to increased stock value, which is associated with more profits), it is not specifically focused on profit maximization. This makes it less similar to the corporate profit maximization approach.\n\n(B) Preference utilitarianism is another normative theory that suggests that the moral course of action is the one that maximizes the total sum of individual preferences. As it is directly based on maximizing preference satisfaction, this theory is more similar to corporate profit maximization, as it is aimed at pleasing the preferences of shareholders, customers, and employees to maximize profits.\n\n(C) The Categorical Imperative is a principle in deontological ethics that suggests that an action is morally right if it commands universal assent. This theory does not focus on profit maximization, as its principles prioritize decisions based on duty, fairness, and consistency rather than financial gain.\n\n(D) Ethics of Care focuses on empathy, interpersonal relationships, and the duty to care for others, rather than pursuing corporate goals such as profit maximization. This theory is least similar to corporate profit maximization.\n\nAfter analyzing the options:\n\nThe most similar normative theory to corporate profit maximization is (B) preference utilitarianism.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let us analyze each option provided and determine which one best aligns with Milton Friedman's belief about business.\n\n(A) The only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders\nMilton Friedman believed in the idea of capitalism and advocated for the free market. He argued that businesses should focus on generating a profit for their shareholders as it fosters economic growth and efficiency. It aligns with option (A).\n\n(B) Managers should act in ways that balance the interest of society and shareholders\nThis statement suggests that managers should consider both the needs of society and shareholders when making decisions for the business. While Friedman believed in prioritizing the interests of shareholders, he did not necessarily seem in favor of completely ignoring the other stakeholders. This option seems to be a more nuanced approach, which does not represent the singular focus on shareholders that Friedman advocated for.\n\n(C) The primary responsibility organizations have is to its employees\nMilton Friedman believed that businesses exist to create wealth for their shareholders and that this drive for profitability should outweigh the needs of other stakeholders. He did not support the idea of prioritizing employee needs above those of shareholders or other stakeholders, as it would hinder the overall goal of creating wealth.\n\n(D) The primary responsibility organizations have is to its stakeholders\nThis option suggests that businesses should focus on fulfilling the needs of various stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, suppliers, and the community. It is a multifaceted approach that acknowledges the various stakeholders a business interacts with, rather than just one particular stakeholder group. Friedman's beliefs on the importance of shareholders do not align with this approach since it prioritizes the needs of other stakeholders over the shareholders' interests.\n\nBased on the analysis of each option and Friedman's beliefs, the single letter answer to the question is:\n\n(A)",

The entities referred to in the context are \"CSOs\" (Civil Society Organizations) and businesses.\n\nIn the context of businesses, Civil Society Organizations usually interact with them for various reasons, such as lobbying for change, offering expertise, or collaborating on certain issues.\n\nNow let's match the given options with the context of the statement.\n\n(A) Legal, Interactions, Mechanics\nThis option seems likely because Civil Society Organizations often engage with the legal system and businesses to further their goals. Legal is related to the processes and mechanisms of law, so it matches the context.\n\n(B) Civil, Relations, Outcomes\nThis option seems less likely because the statement is mainly focused on the relationships between CSOs and businesses, rather than emphasizing the outcome.\n\n(C) Political, Interactions, Outcomes\nThis option seems neutral, as CSOs and businesses may have interactions for political reasons, but the option lacks a clear connection to the processes in this context.\n\n(D) Environmental, Relations, Mechanics\nThis option fits the context better than (C), as it is closely related to the processes and mechanisms in the context of environmental issues. However, it is not specific enough to the relationship between CSOs and businesses.\n\nAfter analyzing the options, the most suitable choice that goes further than the interactions of CSOs with businesses, concerning the processes, is:\n(A) Legal, Interactions, Mechanics",
