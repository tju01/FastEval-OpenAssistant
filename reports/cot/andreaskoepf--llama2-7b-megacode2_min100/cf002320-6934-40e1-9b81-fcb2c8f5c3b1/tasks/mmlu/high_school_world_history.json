One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists.

In this speech, he emphasized the importance of peace and its significance for Asia and Africa.\n\nNow let's examine the options to determine which one is the most plausible for him to have failed at maintaining a neutral stance:\n\n(A) the Arab-Israeli conflict: This conflict took place in 1947-1949, before Indonesia's independence and Sukarno's rise to power. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\n(B) the Korean War: The Korean War began in 1950 and ended in 1953. Since Indonesia gained independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1949 and Sukarno took office in 1950, it is plausible that he attempted to maintain a neutral stance during this conflict.\n\n(C) the Cold War: The Cold War began after World War II and lasted until the early 1990s. Indonesia gained independence from Dutch and Japanese colonial rule during this time. However, Sukarno did not start his political career until 1945, after the war, so it is less likely that he would attempt to maintain neutrality during the entire Cold War.\n\n(D) the Vietnam conflicts: While Indonesia was not directly involved in the Vietnam War, it did provide indirect support to North Vietnam during the conflict. This action would contradict the idea of maintaining neutrality.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most plausible answer to the question is:\n\n(B) the Korean War.",

He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea.

U.S. Army Lt. Paul C. McGrath's account shows that U.S. Col. Bonesteel sought to establish a surrender zone as far north as he believed the Soviets would accept, aiming to prevent them from taking control of all of Korea.\n\nKoreans experienced the immediate divide immediately after the end of the war. The Korean War which followed from 1950-1953 further solidified the division. The conflict began when North Korea invaded South Korea, which led to a large-scale military intervention from the United States and other friendly nations.\n\nAlthough tensions between North and South Korea have eased slightly in recent years, the Korean peninsula remains officially divided along the 38th parallel. The two countries are technically still at war. This division has had substantial impacts on the lives of Koreans on both sides. While some have experienced gradual reunification efforts through cultural exchange programs and other diplomatic means, the political division and the presence of a heavily fortified border, called the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), clearly demonstrate the lasting impact of the events depicted during this time on Korean people.",

He emphasizes that the German people were not given an opportunity to peacefully cooperate or discuss the terms of the treaty as they were being coerced into signing it.\n\nThis focus on the unfair treatment of Germany at the end of World War I is consistent with the largely widespread belief among Germans that the Treaty of Versailles was oppressive and unjust to their country.

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.
