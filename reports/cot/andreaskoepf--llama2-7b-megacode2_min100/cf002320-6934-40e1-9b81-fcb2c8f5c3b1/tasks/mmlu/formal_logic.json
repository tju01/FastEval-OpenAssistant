            "model_answer": "The conclusion of the given argument presented by Sigmund Freud in \"The Origin and Development of Psychoanalysis\" is:\n\n(C) Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\n\nThe reasoning behind this conclusion is that the argument presents two main points. The first point is that it is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients (Statement 1). This implies that emotions affect the cognitive abilities of people, which can lead to less intelligence. The second point is that the arrogance of our consciousness, which is considered to be part of our strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes (Statement 2). \n\nThe conclusion is then derived from these two main points when we realize that this arrogance of the consciousness, which also affects people's defense mechanisms, makes it difficult for them to accept or learn about the unconscious aspects of their selves, as well as understanding what their conscious knowledge contradicts (Statement 3). Therefore, the implied conclusion is that people find it challenging to understand and accept their unconscious minds due to the influence of their consciousness and defense mechanisms.",

            "model_answer": "First, let's figure out which variables represent what.\n\nA crochet hook can be helpful in arranging the variables in a way that simplifies the predicate. We can represent the given relation as follows:\n\n1. David teaches Chris (c: Chris; d: David) (l: learns; t: teaches; x: subject; y: object)\n\nWe can arrange the variables as: (c: Chris; d: David) (x: teaches; y: Chris)\n\nNow, we can approach option (A). In predicate logic, we can represent the relation as follows:\n\nx:teaches(y, Chris)\n\nThe given relation is an instance of the relation, so we can write it as:\n\n(c: Chris; d: David) (x: teaches(y, Chris) \u2192 the Aorist tense of the verb \"teaches\")\n\nAlthough this doesn't exactly represent option (A), we can reach a similar translation with the help of negation and the or clause.\n\nIn predicate logic, we can represent the negation of a relation R as \u00acR, and the or clause as ||. The Aorist tense of the verb \"teaches\" can be represented by (R \u2192 the Aorist tense of \"teaches\"). So, the translation for option (A) becomes:\n\n\u00ac(c: Chris; d: David) (x: ||(y: Chris; R \u2192 the Aorist tense of \"teaches\"))\n\nSince option (A) does not exist in the final translation, we can move on to option (B) as a different approach.\n\nAgain, we can arrange the variables as: (c: Chris; d: David) (x: learns; y: Chris)\n\nIn predicate logic, we can represent the relation as follows:\n\nx:learn(y, Chris)\n\nThis still does not represent option (B). However, with a little negation and the or clause, we can reach a similar translation:\n\nCNF (rip-off of A)\n(c: Chris; d: David) (x: || ||(y: Chris; R \u2192 learn(y, Chris) \u2227 learn(x, Chris)))\n\nThis translation still doesn't match option (B) exactly, but it can be rewritten into option (B):\n\nchronological order of events\n(c: Chris; d: David) (x: learn(x, Chris) \u2192 learn(y, Chris))\n\nFinal answer: Let's look at all the options and see which one works the best.
