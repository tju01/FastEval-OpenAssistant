            "model_answer": "(C) (2, 2)\n\nTo understand the reflection of a pentagon across the line y = x, we need to consider the angles and the location of the vertices. The angles in a pentagon are 30, 45, 90, 45, and 30 degrees.\n\n1. First, we need to find the angle at vertex (0, 0) in the original pentagon P, which is a centroid of the pentagon. To find the angle, we need to add the interior angles of all vertices. The sum of interior angles for vertices add up to 360 degrees.\n   a. interior angle of (\u20132, \u20134) = 45 + 30 + 45\n   b. interior angle of (\u20134, 1) = 30\n   c. interior angle of (\u20131, 4) = 90\n   d. interior angle of (2, 4) = 45\n   e. interior angle of (3, 0) = 30\n\n2. The interior angle at vertex (0, 0) = (a + b) + (c + d) + (e + f)   \n   The sum of all interior angles for the pentagon P = 90 + 30 + 90 + 45 + 30\n   interior angle of (0, 0) = 90 + (30)  (since f = 30)\n\n3. Now we need to find the required angle for P\u2019 at vertex (0, 0) by rotating P\u2019 around y-axis.\n   The new vertex in P\u2019 would have the same angle with other vertices as in the original pentagon P.\n\n4. For P\u2019, at vertex (0, 0), we need the complement of interior angles satisfy 180 - angle = 360, so the angle in P' at vertex (0,0) is 90 degrees.\n\nSince, the new vertex (0,0) in P\u2019 will have the same angle as the original vertex (0,0), the new vertex in P\u2019 associated with the angle 90 degrees is (2,2). Hence, the answer is (C) (2, 2).",

            "model_answer": "We first need to identify the two possible shapes a rectangle can have based on its diagonal being a square root of a perfect square. \n\nLet's consider a rectangle with dimensions 5x and 10x. The length of the diagonal is $5\\sqrt{5}$ (or approximately $13.997$ units).\n\nIf the length of the rectangle is twice its width, then its dimensions are 5x and 10x (but if the length is 5x, the width cannot be 10x, and thus there is a possibility for another type of rectangle, as well).\n\nFor a right triangle with a short side and a diagonal, tan(right angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse, so, the short side's length is $sqrt(2)*diagonal$. It brings us to the formula: length = width + tan(right angle) * height.\n\nIn our case:\n- The length of the rectangle is twice its width, so, width = length - (2 * tan(right angle)).\n- The square of the length is equal to twice the square of the width.\n\nNow we need to find the area for each possible rectangle, which should be equal in both cases.\n\nFor the first case, since the length is 5x, the width is 5x - (2 * tan(90)) = 5x - (2 * 1.414).\nFor the second case, since the length is 10x, the width is 10x - (2 * tan(90)).\n\nLet 'x' be the width for a rectangular frame and 'y' be the length for the rectangle. The diagonal (D) of the rectangle can be calculated as D = sqrt(x^2 + y^2).\n\nSo, the total area of the rectangle (A) is A = (x + y) * D.\n\nNow if we take the average values of x and y for both rectangles, we can calculate the average diagonal length (D), which is D = sqrt(2) * sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = sqrt(2) * D_d.\n\nNow we can calculate the area of the rectangle (A) according to the formula (A = x + y * D), where x and y are taken as average values of the lengths.\n\nCalculating the average values and comparing it with the given answer shows that there is a mistake in the possible answers. \nFrom the correct formula for the area of a rectangle, we can calculate the area as 2(width * height), i.e., the width and height multiplied by each other.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\nArea = x * y = 25 * 10 = 250.",
