            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The destination in this task is to find the price of a single ticket (t) to a concert. To solve for t, we need to write and solve an equation relating the quantity (4t) to the total cost ($112) for the four tickets.\n\nCurrently we are given two options (A) 4t = $448 and (B) 4t = $28; these options imply different prices, so we need to choose one. \n\nOption (B) 4t = $28 has a smaller value, so we will leverage that option to solve for t. To completely understand the reason, we should break the information down to algebraic form. We have a balance that can be represented by the equation 4t = ___ (where the blank is substituted with 112).\n\nFirstly, subtract 4t from both sides of the equation to achieve both sides equaling zero:\n     0 = 4t - 4t\n  Now it can be simplified:\n     0 = 0t\n\nAlthough there is a 0 multiplied by any number, this example is useful because it only involves the dollar sign. In this case, 0 * t (0t) = 0.\n  \nNow the original equation will look like this:\n     0 = 0t\n     0t = 0\n\nThis equation clearly states that the cost of one ticket is 0, which means there is no cost for one ticket if given on equal footing (4 equal groups of 0). But this can't be possible since a ticket typically carries a cost. So, we can be certain that this option (B) isn't correct.\n\nWe must then consider option (A) 4t = $448, since this is the only option left which states the cost of one ticket (t) is $448. To find the cost of one ticket (t), we will divide both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate the cost of one ticket:\n\n(4t / 4) = (448 / 4)\nt = 112\n\nSo, our answer is that the cost of one ticket (t) is $112, which is one of the given options (A). This correct response satisfies the constraints of the problem and produces the desired result. Thus, we can conclude that option (A) is indeed correct and the cost of one ticket (t) is $112.",
