Omega-3 fatty acids are thought to play a role in brain health and function.\n\n(C) A lower level of education: There is no strong evidence to support the idea that a lower level of education is connected with a higher risk of Alzheimer's. In fact, higher education is often associated with better cognitive health and mental function.\n\n(D) Being married: Along with other factors like social engagement and mental activity, being married may provide emotional and social support that can help in maintaining memory and brain health.\n\nBased on the analysis:\nThere is some evidence to suggest that (B) eating fish and (D) being married can have a decreased risk of Alzheimer's, but there is no strong evidence for factor (C).\n\nAnswer: (B) and (D)",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Let's consider each option one by one:\n\n(A) There is a natural process called \"posterior lens opacification\" which can occur with age. This is the thickening of the lens due to accumulation of compact connective tissue and proteins such as collagen and elastin. This can even lead to a condition known as presbyopia, which is the inability to see at close-up.\n\n(B) Age-related macular degeneration can occur in older individuals which is a gradual decline of the macula - the central portion of the retina responsible for providing clear, sharp details in vision. However, the yellowness of the lens or tinting is typically not seen as it ages.\n\n(C) The lens naturally loses some of its elasticity over time due to the aging process. So, it becomes less flexible which can cause it to lose its clarity, and in worst-case scenarios, cause cataracts. Nevertheless, clouding can occur providing vision exposition or excessive light exposure.\n\n(D) The lens normally contains a fluid called \"aqueous humor\" that keeps it mechanically in shape and for correct focusing of the light. This fluid gets cleared of debris and waste materials. While some fluid is replaced, the amount of fluid decreases as a person ages. However, it doesn't fill up with more fluid as one grows older.\n\nStep 2: Conclusion\n\nComparing all the options, only option (C) \"Clouded\" refers to the lens gradually becoming less clear or obstructed as one grows older and is consistent with the aging process. So, the right answer is: (C).",
