            "model_answer": "(C) U.S. settlers were the first to arrive in the region; they claimed it for their country.\n\nReasoning:\nU.S. settlers first arrived in the Oregon Territory in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, traveling westward along the Oregon Trail. As they established their presence in the region, many American pioneers and settlers claimed it was rightfully part of the United States and began establishing settlements on both sides of the Oregon River. In 1846, the United States and Great Britain signed the Oregon Treaty, which acknowledged the U.S. presence in the region and resolved a boundary dispute between the two countries. However, the claim to the area was previously made by U.S. settlers and travelers.",

This could be a potential related issue, but it does not necessarily provide specific enough information to determine if it was integral to the development highlighted in the passage.\n\n(B) A large-scale movement of struggling African American and white farmers, as well as urban factory workers, was able to exert a great deal of leverage over federal legislation.\nThe passage talks about a poor hayseed who was oppressed by monopolies and the railroads, which could imply that the hayseed might be a farmer. However, the movement mentioned here is more focused on African American and white farmers rather than the specifically rural theme of the passage.\n\n(C) The two-party system of the era broke down and led to the emergence of an additional major party that was able to win control of Congress within ten years of its founding.\nWhile the passage does mention the political aspect of the situation, there is no direct reference to the two-party system or political developments within the late 1800s.\n\n(D) Continued skirmishes on the frontier in the 1890s with American Indians created a sense of fear and bitterness among western farmers.\nThis option seems to be the most closely related to the information provided in the passage. The hayseed is described as a poor person, and the passage mentions oppression and railroads.
