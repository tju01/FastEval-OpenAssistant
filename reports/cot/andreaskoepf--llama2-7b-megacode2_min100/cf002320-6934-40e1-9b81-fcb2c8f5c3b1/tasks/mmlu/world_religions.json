            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct translation for \"murtis,\" let us first analyze the term and its meaning in context.\n\n\"Murtis\" is a Hindi term that refers to sacred images or statues of Hindu gods and goddesses, which are considered as symbols of divine presence and played a central role in Hinduism.\n\n(A) Offerings - Offerings can be given to certain deities or gods in Hinduism, but \"murtis\" specifically refers to the image or statue of the god.\n\n(B) Prayers - Although prayers are an important aspect of Hinduism, they do not directly translate to \"murtis.\"\n\n(C) Apparitions - \"Apparitions\" refers to visible or tangible manifestations, often consisting of a spirit or other supernatural force, although the term is not commonly used in the context of Hindu deities.\n\n(D) Idols - Idols are similar to \"murtis,\" as both refer to images or statues of gods or goddesses, but \"murtis\" generally have a higher emphasis since they are considered sacred and involve reciting prayers in Hinduism.\n\nHaving analyzed the options, it seems that \"murtis\" is best translated to (D) Idols, as they both refer to sacred images or statues of deities or spirits in Hinduism.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to determine which of the following naturalist movements are related to studying natural elements and processes:\n\n(A) Daoism: Daoism is a philosophical and religious school of thought that emphasizes natural phenomena, balance, and harmony. It suggests that the Universe is governed by natural laws and principles, emphasizing the importance of living in tune with the flow of nature.\n\n(B) Yin-Yang School: This term does not refer to a specific naturalist movement. The Yin-Yang School refers to teachings and ideas that originated fromChinese philosophical traditions, such as Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism, which all have aspects of exploring natural elements and processes. The Yin-Yang symbol represents the ongoing destructive-creative balance within the universe.\n\n(C) Mengzi: Mengzi (also known as Mencius, depending on the translation) was a Chinese philosopher and Confucian scholar. Although Confucianism has elements that focus on understanding and learning from nature, it is more focused on human interactions, morality, and society than on directly studying natural elements and processes.\n\n(D) Humanistic Buddhism: Humanistic Buddhism focuses on promoting humanistic values and secular understanding of Buddhism, without necessarily emphasizing the importance of observing or understanding natural elements and processes. It acknowledges the teachings of Buddhism, but also promotes the idea of utilizing the wisdom of teachers, finding inspiration in life itself, and engaging in compassionate actions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most suitable answer is:\n\n(A) Daoism",
