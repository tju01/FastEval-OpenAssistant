If Alice and Claire swap gifts next, then Alice and Claire end up with their original gifts. Therefore, Bob ends up with the white present and Claire ends up with the orange ball. This means that Bob does not have the pink ball at the end of the event, so Option A cannot be correct.\n\n- (B) orange ball - If Bob and Claire swap gifts first, then Bob will have the white present and Claire will have the orange ball. If Alice and Claire swap gifts next, then Alice and Claire end up with their original gifts. Therefore, Bob ends up with the orange ball that he had at the start of the event, so Option B is correct.\n\n- (C) white present - If Bob and Claire swap gifts first, then Bob will have the white present and Claire will have the orange ball. If Alice and Claire swap gifts next, then Alice and Claire end up with their original gifts. Therefore, Bob does not end up with the white present at the end of the event, so Option C cannot be correct.\n\nStep 5: Verify the Answer:\nWe have determined that Option B is correct because Bob ends up with the orange ball that he had at the start of the event. let's verify this answer by reviewing the steps taken during the event:\n\n- Bob and Claire swap gifts first: Bob ends up with the white present and Claire ends up with the orange ball.\n- Alice and Claire swap gifts next: Alice and Claire end up with their original gifts.\n- Bob and Claire swap gifts again: Bob ends up with the white present and Claire ends up with the orange ball.\n\nAt the end of the event, Bob has the orange ball that he had at the start of the event. Therefore, the correct answer is Option B.\n\nConclusion:\nThe correct answer to the question is Option B: Bob ends up with the orange ball at the end of the event.

The p-value can then be calculated as 1 - (1 - the area under the curve to the left of 2.5).\n\nFor example, using the standard normal table, you could find that the area under the curve to the left of 2.5 is approximately 0.9922. The p-value would then be calculated as 1 - (1 - 0.9922) = 0.0078 or 0.78%.\nThis means that there is a 0.78% probability that a single group of students would have a mean score of 2.5 or less for a test that normally has a mean score of 3.0 and a standard deviation of 1.0.
