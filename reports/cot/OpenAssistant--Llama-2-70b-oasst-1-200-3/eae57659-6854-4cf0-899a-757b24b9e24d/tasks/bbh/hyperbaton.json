            "model_answer": "**Step 1: Introduce the Problem Parameters**\n\nThe question asks which of two senteces has the correct adjective order.\n\nThe two sentences are:\n- midsize old grey Brazilian sweater\n- midsize grey Brazilian old sweater\n\nBoth sentences have several adjectives describing a sweater, and the question is which one is correctly ordered. Adjective order is important in German, so getting it right is crucial for a successful translation/conversation.\n\n**Step 2: Explain Order\n**\nTo understand in which order the adjectives need to be arranged, we need to understand the article 25.000 of the Herzberg Beasts, the rulers of what is known as the Nearest of Lands which dictate the rules for finer grammar details. Due to copyright restrictions, I can't quote you the article itself, but here's a paraphrasing:\n- adjectives from quality, time, and physical quantity are always ordered on the far left\n- adjectives from colors are next and ordered by how varied their appearance is, from least to most\n- adjectives with origins are the last and are likewise ordered from those least significantly originating towards the most significant\n- in case of ties, the \"less-quirky\" adjective *definitions* are first\n\n**Step 3: Explain their Origins**\n\nAlso, it's key to disambiguate the words.\n- In the first sentence, the word is due to the sweater being old\nIn contrast, in the second sentence, the word old is used to refer to the origin of\nthe sweater.\n(all other adjectives are definitionally unequivocal)\n\n**Step 4: Answer the Question**\n\nOverall, the first sentence can be reinterpreted as a \"midsize old grey Brazilian sweater\", containing a *midsize old grey sweater* originating *Brazilian*.\n\nIn contrast, the second sentence can be reinterpreted as a \"midsize grey Brazilian old sweater\", a *midsize grey Brazilian sweater*, which is old.\n\nAs we can see, the \"midsize old grey Brazilian sweater\"-combination follows the described order (without quality), and the other is missing \"old\", rendering the first sentence correct.\n\n**Step 5: Output**\n\nNow that we went through all the necessary steps, it's time to output the answer.\n\n***(A) midsize old grey Brazilian sweater***",

The first of these adjectives is \"smoking,\" which refers to the concept of a cigarette being lit.  The \"rectangular cloth smoking motorcycle\" could be described as \"rectangular smoking,\" a biased, subjective opinion about the object's shape and whether it is currently emitting smoke.  The second adjective in the Opinion group is \"cloth,\" which refers to the material in which the motorcycle is made.  Thus, the \"rectangular cloth smoking motorcycle\" is a subjective, descriptive way of referring to a motorcycle that is made of cloth, and is currently emitting smoke.\n\nThe adjective \"rectangular\" is placed before the adjective \"cloth\" because it is the most important adjective in the group. The X, triangular, and rectangular adjective order goes from left to right: X(X_ say motorcycle), triangular, rect, meso.* This is the standard order for the adjective groups: X/Y(X or Y,) triangular, rect, meso.\n\nBased on the above explanation, option B has the correct adjective order.

The first word is \"spherical,\" which is an adjective that describes the shape of the knife. This is followed by \"ancient,\" which is an adjective that describes the age of the knife. Finally, \"midsize\" is used to describe the size of the knife.

The first rule is that the adjective closest to the noun should be the one that describes the noun. According to this rule, the adjective that describes the noun \"computer\" should be the last one.\n\nAnother rule is that adjectives that describe the surface or quality of the noun should be placed before adjectives that describe the number or quantity of the noun.\n\nIn the case of Option (A), we can see that \"pyramidal\" and \"grey\" describe the surface and color of the computer, while \"Indian\" describes its nationality.\n\nLikewise, \"cloth\" seems to be the most logical adjective to describe the material or physical qualities of the computer.\n\nNow, we can rearrange these adjectives in order of priority, based on the rules mentioned above. The resulting sentence would be:\n\n(A) good pyramidal Indian grey cloth computer.\n\nOption (B): good pyramidal Indian cloth computer\n\nThis option contains four adjectives, which can be arranged in the following order: good (the adjective closest to the noun that describes it), pyramidal (the surface or shape), Indian (the nationality), and cloth (the material or physical quality).\n\nLet's rearrange the adjectives in Option (B) according to the rules of adjective order:\n\n(B) good Indian pyramidal cloth computer.\n\nNow, comparing the two options, we can see that they both have slightly different adjective orders.\nHowever, only Option (B) contains all the adjectives in the correct order according to the rules of adjective order.

While there are exceptions to this rule, most sentences follow this order.\n\nFor our sentence, the order of adjectives should be:\n\n(A) Pakistani normal-size white paper good snorkeling monkey\n\nThe first adjective, \"Pakistani,\" describes the monkey's nationality. Next, \"normal-size\" describes the size of the monkey. After that, \"white\" describes the color of the monkey. \"Paper\" is the material that the snorkel is made of, so that follows.\n\nThe adjective \"good\" is describing the monkey's skills (most probably it's a theoretical assumption), in this case, \"snorkeling,\" so \"good\" goes next.

The more specific the adjective, the closer it should be to the noun.\n\nHere are the 8 types of adjectives in order of increasing specificity:\n\n1. Determiners: articles (a, an, the), possessive pronouns (my, your, his, her, our, their), demonstrative pronouns (this, that, these, those), quantifiers (some, many, few, all, most, etc.)\n\n2. Opinion: words that express an opinion, attitude, or value judgment (e.g. good, bad, beautiful, ugly, weird, interesting)\n\n3. Size: words that describe the size or extent of something (e.g. small, big, tall, short, large, huge, tiny, enormous)\n\n4. Shape: words that describe the shape, outline, or contour of something (e.g. round, square, rectangular, curved, angular, straight)\n\n5. Age: words that describe the age or period of something or someone (e.g. new, old, ancient, modern, young, old-fashioned)\n\n6. Color: words that describe the color of something (e.g. red, blue, green, yellow, brown, purple)\n\n7. Origin: words that specify the origin or source of something or someone (e.g. French, German, American, Japanese, African)\n\n8. Material: words that denote the material of which something is made (e.g. silver, gold, wood, plastic, glass)\n\n\nApplication to Options:\n(A) rectangular silver ancient green ridiculous big knife\nLet's start by identifying the type of adjective for each word.\nrectangular - shape\nsilver - material\nancient - age\ngreen - color\nridiculous - opinion\nbig - size\nknife - noun\n\nSince shape, material, and color adjectives are more specific than age and opinion adjectives, the correct order should place those adjectives before age and opinion.

            "model_answer": "The correct adjective order is a complicated concept and world-class writers tend to disagree as to the *best* ordering. Nevertheless, ther are several tips for improving the order of your adjectives, with the main focus being on ordering by importance.\n\nLet's go through with these tips\nRule 1 is to order the adjectives by length or by complexity. Adjectives are usually the shorter and simpler first followed by the longer and more complex adjectives. So Cardboard, ridiculous, whittling and grey would be in the order shortest to longest. The motorcycle however it a single word and not an adjective, instead it's a noun. This concludes rule number 1.\n\nRule 2 is to order the adjectives by opinion-to-fact adjectives. Individual opinions are usually listed first followed by the objective or factual descriptions. The according rule would place ridiculous as the first adjective as it is entirely subjective.\n\nRule 3 places adjectives which are subject to a standard order in that order. For example size comes before color. A simple example would be with  'big red balloon'. If we were to use the adjective order cardboard, ridiculous, grey motorcycle we would be looking at the order \"color, opinion, material type\" cardboard, ridiculous, grey.\n\nRule 4 is ordering by logical progression. When you formulate a description of an item the order in which you list each adjective logically stems from the item. In this case we describe a cardboard motorcyle as ridiculous, as cardboad in in incredibly unusual material for making a motorcycle.\n\nThe correct answer is B. Cardboard, ridiculous, grey motorcycle. This is because when one views a description all the way from beginning to the end, one builds a profile which reaches it's climax with the descriptive word 'Motorcycle'. This helps from the picture of a ridiculous red motorcycle being built in your head.\n\nRules 2 and 3 do not matter if other factors are more important. Ridiculous is much more important than a order of opinion-to fact, or size-color. Likewise grey could also be described as a size - it is unusually small - or it could factor into rule four, as describing a grey whittling motorcycle could have the climax in grey, which is a rather unusual color for a motorcyle.",
