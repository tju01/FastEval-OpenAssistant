This is an example of\n\n(A) directional selection.\n(B) stabilizing selection.\n(C) sexual selection.\n(D) disruptive selection.",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Sure! Let's break down this question step by step and explain the reasoning behind each option:\n\n(A) Directional selection: This occurs when a specific trait shifts in either a positive or negative direction within a population, usually due to environmental changes. For instance, if an environmental change occurs that favors individuals that are taller, then over time more individuals will survive and pass along their genetic information. Therefore, the traits of the population will shift towards being taller, showing directional selection.\n\n(B) Stabilizing selection: This occurs when the average trait of a population remains relatively constant over time. However, in this case the environmental change favors individuals that are tallest, meaning that the traits of the population will shift over time, so this option does not apply.\n\n(C) Sexual selection: This occurs when individuals of one sex select their mates based on physical traits, leading to the selection of these traits in the population. However, this is not the case in this question since the change in the trait of the population is in response to an environmental change, not sexual selection.\n\n(D) Disruptive selection: This occurs when two extremes of a trait are selected in a population, usually due to different environmental conditions. However, in this case the environmental change favors individuals that are tallest, so there is no evidence of disruptive selection.\n\nTherefore, based on the reasoning above, the correct answer is (A) Directional selection. An environmental change occurred that favored individuals that were taller, causing the population to shift towards being taller, showing directional selection.",

            "question": "Which of the changes below following the start codon in an mRNA would most likely have the greatest deleterious effect?\n\n(A) a deletion of a single nucleotide\n(B) a deletion of a nucleotide triplet\n(C) a single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the first codon position\n(D) a single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the third codon position",

            "model_answer": "I will try to answer your question step-by-step. Let's first understand what are start codons and how they work.\n\nIntroduction to Start Codons\nIn eukaryotic cells, genes are first transcribed into a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA moves to the ribosome and is then translated into specific amino acid sequences through a process called translation. The start codon is the first codon in the mRNA that codes for a particular amino acid sequence. It signals the beginning of the protein synthesis process. The most common start codon is AUG (see Wikipedia for more details).\n\nDeletion of a Single Nucleotide\nOption (A) involves deleting a single nucleotide from the start codon. This results in changing the start codon from AUG to either AUU, AUG, or AUA. These changes would lead to a premature stop codon in the mRNA, resulting in an incomplete and probably non-functional protein (MOOC lessons on how stop codons work explains this well).\n\nDeletion of a Nucleotide Triplet\nOption (B) involves deleting a nucleotide triplet from the start codon. This would change the start codon from AUG to one of the following: AUA, AUU, AUC, AUG, AUA, ACA, and AGA. All of these codons are known as to specify specific amino acids, so this would probably not lead to a complete destruction of the protein. However, part of the protein would be missing or incomplete.\n\nSingle Nucleotide Substitution in the First Codon Position\nOption (C) involves a single nucleotide substitution in the first codon position, thereby changing the start codon from AUG to one of the following: AAG, AAC, AAA, AAT. According to the MOOC lecture on codon translation, all these options are known to code for specific amino acids, and changing the start codon would almost certainly result in a nonfunctional protein.\n\nSingle Nucleotide Substitution in the Third Codon Position\nOption (D) involves a single nucleotide substitution in the last, third position of the codon. According to our knowledge of start codons (MOOC lecture on codon translation), this would lead to either one of the following start codons: AUGCC, AUGCU, AUGAC, AUGAG. All these start codons are known to code or specific amino acids. While the protein may be slightly different than usual, the changes would likely not lead to a complete dysfunction of the protein.\n\nConclusion\nTherefore, I conclude that option (C) would lead to the most deleterious effect. The other options would lead to varying degrees of impairment, but option (C) would be the worst.",

The electron transport chain is a series of protein complexes located in the inner mitochondrial membrane.
