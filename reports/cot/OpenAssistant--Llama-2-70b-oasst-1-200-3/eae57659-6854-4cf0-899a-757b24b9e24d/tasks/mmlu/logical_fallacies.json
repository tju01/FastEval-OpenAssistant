            "model_answer": "To begin, let's start with some background on disjunctive syllogisms. A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument in which a conclusion is drawn from two disjunctive premises, or premises that state alternatives. In other words, a disjunctive syllogism is a form of argument that involves the logical rule of disjunction (or \"either-or\" statements) and the law of syllogism (a type of deductive logic).\n\nSo, by definition, a valid disjunctive syllogism must include two or more alternatives in its major premise. This means that option A is the correct answer to the given question.\n\nOption B, classifying subjects, is not directly related to the definition of a valid disjunctive syllogism.\n\nOption C, affirming the antecedent or denying the consequent, is also not a requirement for a valid disjunctive syllogism. Although it is important in other types of logical arguments, it is not a necessary part of a disjunctive syllogism.\n\nHowever, option D, leading to a valid conclusion, is a significant factor in the determination of whether a disjunctive syllogism is valid or invalid. In order for a disjunctive syllogism to be valid, the conclusion must be logically sound and follow from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"A valid disjunctive syllogism has a major premise that:\" is option A, \"includes two or more alternatives.\" This option is supported by the definition of a disjunctive syllogism, which requires that the major premise of such an argument include two or more alternatives.\n\nThe final answer is: (A)",

            "model_answer": "The question is asking about a fallacy. In logic, a fallacy is an error in reasoning that occurs when we reach a conclusion without supporting evidence or without considering all relevant information. Some common fallacies in logic include fallacies of style over substance, context avoidance, appeal to authority, appeal to emotion, and argumentum ad hominem. \n\nIn fallacies of \"style over substance,\" or \"form over matter,\" the error of reasoning lies in the fact that an argument is based largely on style or form instead of on substantial reasoning or content. A common example of this is when people argue that something must be true because it sounds good (e.g., all great speakers are good writers), even though there is no evidence to support this claim. \n\nSo now we have to determine which statement from the above list best describes the fallacy of style over substance. Let us examine each one. \n\n(A) Changing the meaning of a word or phrase from one part of an argument to another. While this can be an example of fallacy, it does not describe style over substance. It should not be considered as the fallacy in our context, so we can rule it out. \n\n(B) Confusing figurative language with literal language. This is another common fallacy, but not related to style over substance. We can rule this out as well. \n\n(C) Reasoning that ideas presented in an appealing manner are correct, regardless of the content of the message. This statement describes our fallacy in that it emphasizes form or style over substance by suggesting that ideas presented in an appealing manner must be correct regardless of their content or merit. \n\n(D) Using emotionally charged language to create an impression about the subject of a claim, without making an argument that the language fits the subject. This fallacy is closely related to fallacies of style over substance because it relies on emotional language instead of substantial reasoning. However, it does not apply here because it assumes that there is no argument made at all besides using strong language alone, which is not the case for this question. \n\nIn conclusion, based on our reasoning, we can rule out option (A) and option (D). Option (C) describes \"style over substance,\" so C would be the answer.\n\nHope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions. Have an amazing day today.\n\nI'M NOT A ROBOT!",

I'll explain my reasoning step by step.\n\n(1) A way of suppressing evidence that eliminates a source of evidence from consideration is poisoning the well.\n\n(2) Poisoning the well is a logical fallacy in which the speaker discredits their opponent's argument by attacking the opponent's character, rather than the substance of their argument. This tactic deters the audience from taking the opponent's argument seriously.\n\n(3) In the example given, the flaw being attributed to the source of evidence has no true relationship with the reliability of the source.

            "model_answer": "The false analogy fallacy is:\n\n  1. For a pair \u27e8x, y\u27e9 to exhibit the false analogy fallacy, it must exhibit a \"comparison\" and this comparison must be \"based on\" something that is false according to the \"constraint\" *\"i.*\n  2. There is nothing in the world that some property of which following \"must\" necessarily follow \"from\" the immediate past of this property.\n  3. Only two things are similar enough for there to exist necessarily anything about the past of one thing having anything to do with the other. It has been said that nothing truly similar to the human race has ever existed before the human race came into existence. However, this can be wrong or untrue for some views of existence and so I cannot say these things are similar enough for necessarily anything about the past of one having anything to do with the other. The other thing that is similar enough to the human race for necessarily anything about the past of the latter having anything to do with the former containing the former *perhaps is the human race itself*.\n  4. Before humans existed, there existed things with no humans existing, yet the prior non-presence of humans cannot be the cause of the existence of humans before the first human the same that the past of all immediate past of the first person was necessarily not filled with human beings.\n  5. (A) says \"a specific type of false cause fallacy\" and it can be proven informally that this proposition is true from first and second figure hypothetical syllogisms, but contains the wording \"specific type\" and there is a specific type of \"false cause fallacy\" where an event that did something to cause the other event did so in the absence of any people. Therefore, (A) is not the answer.\n  6. True propositional statements \"can be used together in meaningful ways\" (\"natural deduction\").\n  7. Each and every complete deduction leads to one and only one proposition, but the term \"another event\" in (B) is used only on inference 1. In information theory, this can imply that a singular event occurs on its own with no problem. However, there is nothing in the world with which \"to compare\" this prospective event with other things, event from which to compare the event causally to event (B) (the second of two events happening at once) which attains nothing causally. This also implies that\n\n*The term \"specific type\" is not used to describe that event in (A). It is that event however, something described or at least that fails to approximate someone. In that case, it is the event from which to compare event (A) which begins the comparison, not the false analogy fallacy as (C) says. It is the false analogy fallacy (not something else) that is the comparison itself, disinfecting the successfulness of inferring a causative relationship between two events not yet-present and now-present.* The universe, literally?, could prove this untrue because this proposition possibly is not an event in or of the universe, but the only two things that could and even might be similar enough are, as said in 3., the human race and the human race. B and C thus follow that fallacy highly preferably more than A and D, and are most likely not answered by A, also by implication due to their veracity (A) being adopted as the fallacy, also once again by implication, meaning (B) or (C). At the very least, (C) introduces no more of a meaningful statement not \"able to say\" in a reasonable way: it is inferentially more plausible with more extensive proof, as (C) only contains wit and observation of present dynamics in terms of fallacy hypothetically relevant to what is being asked, nothing more. The universe can prove \"I tolerate and allow people\" unlike propositions in English.\n  8. Propositions using only noun parameters like \"events\" attribute to perceptional phenomena, so anything in the world can be relevant to \"an-otherness\" about choices with \"only\" the perceptional phenomena. (D) also does not \"know that,\" so it is not used here knowingly.\n  9. Immediately from 8.((I)) the universe should \"require\" a recent causative inference of what a comparison is (it couldn't \"do\" also-not-inferred-with-another truthfullness, so \"necessity\" with original identity is invalid), using (B) as meaningfulness to support explanation of what \"compare\" is (rather than \"necessity\" to fruits) in the plentiful ways as illustrated in 8((C))(, or alternatively as opposed to 8((E) since otherwise (D) could compare the delivery of it is fruit to the air. In such a case, 8((D)) would be enough - metaphysics is enough (D) as this) any idea of the universe giving internal \"inner dialogue\" (possible implicitly self-depreciating) is precisely ridiculous (i.e., if called \"fantasy\") in favor of completion of form towards the 8((B))(\"create nothing to creat[ion]site\"), beginning the 8-(C)((see (D)))(\"base\" = (D))[^1] comarison and without necessitating any misleading havoc with) ((air means all comedic physicists are used until singular non-comedic",

False criteria: This fallacy occurs when an argument is based on flawed criteria. It involves using evaluative terms that are either biased or inaccurate, resulting in the argument being invalid.\n\nB. Hasty generalization: This fallacy occurs when an argument is made based on insufficient evidence or experience. The argument is based on a sample that is too small or unrepresentative to support a generalized conclusion.\n\nC. Ad crumenam: This fallacy involves arguing for or against something based on a personal attack or appeal to wealth instead of focusing on the merits of the argument.\n\nD. Division: This fallacy occurs when an argument assumes that what is true of the whole must also be true of its parts and vice versa. The fallacy occurs when the argument treats the parts and the whole as interchangeable.\n\nStep 4. Making an informed conclusion\n\nUpon reviewing the fallacies mentioned, I found that the \"Division\" fallacy involves assuming that what is true of the whole must be true of its parts and vice versa. This is consistent with the fallacy described in the question, where the arguer assumes that what is true of an entire object is also true of each part of that object.
