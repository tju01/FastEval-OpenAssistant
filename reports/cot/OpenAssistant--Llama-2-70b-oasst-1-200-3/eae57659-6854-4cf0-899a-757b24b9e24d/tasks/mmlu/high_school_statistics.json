            "question": "The waiting times for a new roller coaster ride are normally distributed with a mean of 35 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes. If there are 150,000 riders the first summer, which of the following is the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders?\n\n(A) 0 to 31.7 minutes\n(B) 31.7 to 39.3 minutes\n(C) 25.3 to 44.7 minutes\n(D) 25.3 to 35 minutes",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "According to the question, the mean and standard deviation of waiting time for new roller coaster ride are 35 minutes and 10 minutes respectively. Since, the distribution is normal, 68.26% of all riders will wait between -1 standard error and +1 standard error, i.e. between 25.3 minutes and 44.7 minutes. Hence, 100,000 riders will at least have to wait less than 25.3 minutes. So, the number of riders that didn't have to wait for more than 25.3 minutes would be equal to (150,000-100,000) = 50,000. We can compute the probability that a rider would have to wait at least 25.3 minutes using the normal distribution formula as follows:\n\n    F(x) = (1/\u221a(2\u03c0\u03c3^2)) e^(-(x-\u03bc)^2/2\u03c3^2)\n\nwhere,\nF(x) =  probability\n\u03bc = Mean which is 35 minutes.\n\u03c3 = standard deviation which is 10 minutes.\nx = 25.3 minutes in this case.\n\nSubstituting the values in the got earlier, we get 0.0410678727. Hence, the percentage of riders waiting more than 25.3 minutes is equal to 1 - 0.0410678727 = 0.9589321273. Hence, we can say that if there are 150000 riders, the number of riders that will have to wait between 25.3 and 35 minutes will be (0.9589321273 * 150000) = 143839.23 (rounded to 2 decimal places).\nSo, the correct choice is option C.",

The mean height of adult women is 66 inches, with a standard deviation of three inches. Between a man with a height of 74 inches and a woman with a height of 70 inches, who is more unusually tall within his or her respective sex?\n\nThe standard deviation tells us how much the values in a dataset deviate from the mean value. The smaller the standard deviation, the less spread out the values are and the more concentrated they are around the mean. In other words, a small standard deviation means that the values in a dataset are close to the mean value, while a large standard deviation means that the values are more spread out and different from the mean value.\n\n\n\nThe standard deviation is used to measure the spread or variation in a dataset. It tells us how far the values are from the mean value. The larger the standard deviation, the more spread out the values are and the less concentrated they are around the mean.\n\nTo understand whether someone is unusually tall or short within their respective sex group, we need to compare their height to the mean height of their group and the standard deviation.\n\n\n\nLet's start with the man who has a height of 74 inches. The mean height of adult men is 70 inches, and the standard deviation is four inches. Therefore, we can calculate how far the man's height is from the mean value using the following formula:\n\nz-score = (height - mean height) / standard deviation\n\nz-score = (74 - 70) / 4\n\nz-score = 1\n\nThis means that the man's height is one standard deviation above the mean height of adult men, which is considered normal or average.\n\n\n\nNow, let's consider the woman who has a height of 70 inches. The mean height of adult women is 66 inches, and the standard deviation is three inches. Therefore, we can calculate how far the woman's height is from the mean value using the following formula:\n\nz-score = (height - mean height) / standard deviation\n\nz-score = (70 - 66) / 3\n\nz-score = 1.33\n\nThis means that the woman's height is 1.33 standard deviations above the mean height of adult women, which is considered to be more unusual or abnormal than the man's height being one standard deviation above the mean height of adult men.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the woman is more unusually tall than the man within their respective sex group.\n\n\n\n**Based on the discussion, the final answer is (D), the woman, because her height is 1.33 standard deviations above the mean height of all women, whereas the man's height is only one standard deviation above the mean height of all men.**\n\n\nI trust that this answer will help you to better understand the concept of standard deviation and how it can be used to determine whether someone is abnormally tall or short.

The T-distributions are always right-skewed which means that T-distributions will likely give more values on lower side of the mean than the normal distribution.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, one must consider the experimental design of the study in question. In particular, one needs to understand the difference between observational studies and experiments and their components.\n\nAn observational study is a type of scientific research in which scientists neither assign the treatments nor control the study conditions. In an observational study, data are collected, and certain outcomes of interest are measured. No intervention occurs. However, potential variables of interest can still be measured and experimental comparisons made.\n\nAn experiment is a controlled process that involves manipulating one or more independent variables to determine their effect on a dependent variable. Potential causes are variations of a treatment, i.e., what is done to the subjects in an experiment. In a controlled experiment, several study groups are set up in which at least one of the groups is exposed to a control treatment. \n\nThe control treatment is designed to isolate the specific effect of the treatment being studied. Blocking is a technique in which randomization is augmented to address other sources of variation that may be confounding the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n\nReturning to the information in the question, we can observe that subjects were randomly selected and given three beers to consume. However, no information is provided about the treatment or control groups, making it impossible to determine whether this study was an experiment or an observational study.\n\nAlthough blocking is a critical factor in experimental design, without more information about the underlying study, it is impossible to say whether the lack of blocking compromised the validity of the experiment.\n\nIf subjects were used as their own controls, the study could be considered an experiment since it involves the use of a control treatment and the measurement of a dependent outcome. However, since I don't have access to the full details of the study, it is impossible to confirm whether this is correct or not.\n\nIn summary, without more information about the underlying experiment, it's impossible to provide a definitive answer to this question. Therefore, my recommendation is that further information be obtained about the underlying experiment before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.\n\nFinal answer: (C) The placebo effect is irrelevant in this type of study.",
