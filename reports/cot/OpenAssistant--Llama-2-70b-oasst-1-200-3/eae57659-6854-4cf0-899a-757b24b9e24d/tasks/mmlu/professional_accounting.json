Nonissuer audits are subject to different regulations and standards than audits of publicly-traded companies.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the correctness of statement A - Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population. This statement is correct because nonsampling risk is the risk that arises from the possibility that the auditor failed to use appropriate auditing procedures or did not adequately apply the ones that were selected. Hence, B and C are incorrect because they do not talk about nonsampling risk in context of testing a sample instead of entire population. D is incorrect because it does not talk about nonsampling risks but rather talks about sampling risk.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the correctness of statement B - Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements. This statement is incorrect because nonsampling risk can arise due to misstatements, but it is not specifically related to failing to recognize misstatements.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the correctness of statement C - Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks. This statement is incorrect because sampling risk is the risk that the auditor selected an inappropriate sample size or failed to apply appropriate auditing procedures to that sample.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the correctness of statement D - Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective. This statement is incorrect because sampling risk is not related to selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate.\n\nStep 7: Choose the correct answer.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "I will follow your instructions and explain my reasoning step-by-step.\n\nIn this scenario, the FASB is making changes to the Accounting Standards Codification. The FASB is responsible for setting and issuing accounting standards and principles in the US. The Accounting Standards Codification is a comprehensive set of rules and standards that encompass all US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nNow, the question is, by which way does the FASB makes these changes. Let's go through each option one by one:\n\nA) Accounting Standards Updates: ASUs are a type of accounting standard issued by the FASB to address specific issues or topics in accounting. These updates typically provide guidance or clarification on existing accounting standards or introduce new guidance.\n\nB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Releases: EITF is a subgroup of FASB that was established to provide guidance on emerging transactions, contracts, practices and other matters that may raise questions about the applicability of one or more topics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The EITF may issue exposure drafts, consensuses, and task force consensuses related to these issues.\n\nC) Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS): SFASs were a type of accounting standard issued by FASB before the creation of the Accounting Standards Codification. SFASs were meant to form the basis of authoritative GAAP. However, since 2009, SFASs have been incorporated into the Accounting Standards Codification and no longer issued. It seems that most likely this standard is outdated and not used in the current accounting environment.\n\nD) Staff Technical Bulletins: Staff technical bulletins are issued by FASB staff to provide guidance on implementation issues without requiring a formal vote by the FASB board. These bulletins are not part of the authoritative accounting literature. They are non-authoritative but are considered good accounting guidance by many accountants. While these are meant primarily get into implementation details of existing standards, they may sometimes cover conceptual approach too by clarifying possible misunderstanding in the standards.\n\nIn this particular scenario where FASB is the issuing changes to the Accounting Standards Codification, they will be most likely doing that by Accounting Standards Updates. Therefore, the best answer for this question would be option A.\n\nIs that what you were looking for?

            "model_answer": "To calculate the effect of the error in amortization of the bond premium on the bond carrying amount, retained earnings, and bond interest expense, we need to compare the straight-line and effective-interest methods of amortization. Let's assume the bond premium is $10,000.\n\nThe straight-line method divides the bond premium by the number of years to maturity. So, the amortization of the bond premium would be $1,000 per year in both year 7 ($10,000 / 10 years) and year 11 ($10,000 / 10 years).\n\nHowever, the effective-interest method applies the market rate at issuance to determine the annual amortization. Since the market rate is unknown, we assume it will be the same throughout the life of the bond. The market rate would be determined by comparing the market interest rate to the contractual interest rate.\n\nIn year 7, let's assume the market rate is 7%. The effective-interest amortization would be $700 in year 7 ($10,000 * 7% / 2). In year 11, the market rate is 6%. The effective-interest amortization would be $740 in year 11 ($9,300 * 6% / 2).\n\nBond carrying amount: Since the bond premium of $10,000 is not amortized fully, the bond carrying amount is overstated by $2,260 ($10,000 - ($700 + $740)).\n\nRetained earnings: Since the bond interest expense is understated by $300 in year 7 and $100 in year 11, the retained earnings are overstated by $400 ($300 + $100).\n\nBond interest expense: Since the bond interest expense is calculated by adding the coupon interest ($12,000,000 * 6%) plus the amortization of bond premium, the bond interest expense is understated by $300 in year 7 and $100 in year 11.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A): Overstated Understated.\n\nThank you for using my services.

In accounting terms, it is classified as a non-current asset rather than a current asset. So, option A is correct.\n\n1. **Option B:** It will be classified as a current asset.\n\n    This option is incorrect because the old building will be classified as a non-current asset, not a current asset, as it was reclassified as an asset held for sale. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n1. **Option C:** It will no longer be depreciated.\n\n    This option is correct because when a building is being prepared for sale, it is no longer depreciated according to IAS 16 Property, Plant, and Equipment. As a result, it will no longer be depreciated. Thus, option C is correct.\n\n1. **Option D:** It will be valued at historical cost.\n\n    This option is incorrect because the old building will not be valued at historical cost when it is being actively marketed for sale. Instead, it will be measured at the lower of the carrying amount and the estimated fair value less costs of disposal. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer to the question is B because the old building will not be classified as a current asset when it is reclassified as an asset held for sale.
