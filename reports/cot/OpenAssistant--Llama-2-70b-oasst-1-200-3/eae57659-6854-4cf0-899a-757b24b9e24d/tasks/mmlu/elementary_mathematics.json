            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Okay, here is my step-by-step reasoning to answer the question:\n\n- Let us first calculate the total number of days that Ms. Perez drove:\n    - 40 miles total distance\n    - 5 days\n    - Therefore, Ms. Perez drove an average of 8 miles per day. This means that each day, she drove the same number of miles.\n- Now, we need to figure out how many miles Ms. Perez drove each day. To do this, we need to divide the total number of miles by the number of days.\n    - 40 miles / 5 days = 8 miles\n- Therefore, Ms. Perez drove 8 miles each day.\n\nThe answer is: C) 8 miles per day.\n\nHope this helps!

For example, 2.16 and 0.06 are both expressed in decimal places, so it is safe to assume that we can divide them without losing precision.\n\nNow, let's calculate the quotient. To do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n- Multiply both 2.16 and 0.06 by 100 so that we have integers to work with. This gives us 216 and 6, respectively.\n\n- Divide 216 by 6 using long division. You can use the following steps:\n  - 216 \u2192 2|16 = 13 r 4 \n  - Bring down the next digit, 4 from 16 to the right: 16 \u2192 16 \n  - 6 goes into 16 exactly 2 times, leaving 4 \n  - Write the answer, 2 above the 4\n  - Multiply 2x6=12 to subtract and write the remainder above the 16 as 2: 16 \u2192 12|4, 16 \u2192 12|4 = 4 (2)\n- Finish off with the remainder 4: 2|4 \u2192 1: 2|4 = 1\n\nTherefore, the correct quotient is 36, which is represented as option B in our original question.
