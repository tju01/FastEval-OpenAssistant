            "model_answer": "Question: \nLet x = 1. What is x << 3 in Python 3?\n\nExplanation: The binary shift-left operator (<<) shifts the bits of a number N places to the left, where N is the second operand of the operator. For example, a << 2 means the binary representation of a is shifted two places to the left (or that bits that occupy the places 2 and 3 are filled with zeroes).\n\nIn Python 3, a and b are converted to integers before the bitwise operation '<<' is applied, and the operation results in an integer that has the same number of bits as the original a.\n\nHere, x = 1 has the binary representation of 00000000000000000000000000000001.\nTherefore, x << 3 results in 1<<3 = 8 binary digits that set to 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) 8.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what each function does and whether it can be used to convert a string to an integer in Python 3.\n\n**int(x [,base])**: This function takes a base *x* where *x* can be a number or a known symbol (e.g. \"e,\" \"E,\" \"j,\" \"J,\" or \"I\"). The base should be an integer, and it is used to determine the base of the integer to convert (i.e. 10 for decimal, 16 for hexadecimal).\n\n**long(x [,base])**: This function is identical to the int() function, except that it returns a long integer instead of a normal integer. However, if you're using Python 3.10 or above, this function has been removed and Python now uses int() for both integer and non-integer numbers. If you're using an older version of Python, this function returns a single integer number when *x* is non-numeric, i.e. *x* is an alphanumeric string. Suppose you have the tuple **(x [\"abc\" 10])**. In Python 3.10 or above, the int() function will raise an exception: **ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10**.\n\n**float(x)**: This function converts the argument, which must be a vector, matrix, or list, to floating point values. It is for numeric types only, so we can eliminate this option.\n\n**str(x)**: This is a string conversion function that doesn't do any numeric or ``int()`` evaluation but does numerical conversions. However, from Python 3.9 forward, when all elements of the vector are of numeric type, it behaves like int().\n\nThe answer is therefore A. However, if you're using Python 3.10 or above, this function returns a single integer number when *x* is non-numeric, i.e. *x* is an alphanumeric string. Suppose you have the tuple **(x [\"abc\" 10])**. In Python 3.10 or above, the int() function will raise an exception: **ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10**. Finally, from Python 3.9 forward, when all elements of the vector are of numeric type, the str() function behaves like int(). So if you have a list that is all numeric, then str() = int().",

This file is sent in packets. These packets must be sent from the web server to the user's computer and reassembled. After this, the browser can interpret the reassembled packets and display the file to the user.

The answer is (A): Do students majoring in computer science tend to have higher grade point averages than students majoring in other subjects?\n\nThe data provided in the table contains information about each student's gender, state, and grade point average. To answer this question, we can use the student's grade point average information.\n\nWe can first calculate the average grade point average for students majoring in computer science.

If the average grade point average for computer science majors is higher than that of students majoring in other subjects, then we can conclude that computer science majors tend to have higher grade point averages.\n\nThis answer is supported by the fact that the student's grade point average is the only variable in the data set that allows us to compare students' academic performance across different majors.

For example, we cannot use the student's gender or state information to compare academic performance across different majors.\n\nTherefore, choosing (A) as the answer is correct.
